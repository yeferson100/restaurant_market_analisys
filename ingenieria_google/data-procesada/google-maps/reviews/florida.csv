2020-10-06 16:22:48.099,4,"This a must try!!! The Whiting was seasoned and fried to perfection!! The shrimp was great! The crab cluster in the boil bag was AMAZING!! it was huge!! Also received shrimp in the bag which were a nice size and seasoned very well.  Customer service was great, very friendly, food was prepared in a timely manner! I hate to complain but I'd loved to have a larger portion of fries, the corn was overcooked, and the crab was mushy but the batter was amazing. I'd definitely go back",0x89ba97718dd7f71d:0x9dbb50b003f0b6ce,VA
2021-06-28 15:06:14.422,3,I really tried to support our people. This is the ghettos place I've been to. They don't give you a receipt they say check your statement. they offer you a drink  with your meal but The lady said if you don't ask for your drink you won't get it and they have no ice,0x89ba97718dd7f71d:0x9dbb50b003f0b6ce,VA
2020-07-31 07:46:27.983,5,Black Owned. You asked for it and now you have it. Excellent service and really good price but I must warn you that the crabs are ridiculously good. My family are crab critics and they just kept telling me how good they taste. This is called Rich's Seafood and he does a lot. This is the new official official spot to get your crabs. The flavor is different from any crabs I have had locally. You definitely won't have to steam your own crabs anymore. Just give this establishment 1 try and you will be very impressed. Keep up the great work and expand when you can!,0x89ba97718dd7f71d:0x9dbb50b003f0b6ce,VA
2020-08-22 22:26:47.262,5,I always order my live crabs here.  They give you a bang for your buck.   The live crabs are always fresh.  I just tried their crabcakes...OMG.  THEY WERE HUGE AND SCRUPTIOUS.  Best crabcakes I've tasted in this area in a long time.  Prices are reasonable.  Not cheap but reasonably priced.  Its well worth it. The picture below is for size comparison to their crabcakes and a large egg.  Wow,0x89ba97718dd7f71d:0x9dbb50b003f0b6ce,VA

When we sat down they already gave us on the house edamame which was awesome to begin the experience with. We ordered tempura shrimp and it had the most magnificent sauce to dip it in. I couldn't describe it. You just got to try. Their house salad has the awesome ginger dressing as well. We also order boat combination number 2. I mean from the picture you can see how fulfilling it was. We had to take it home. In between, they even gave us veggie spring roll on the house. All the food we tried had awesome full flavors and you could tell they weren't holding back with their ingredients. I'm coming back here often since it isn't too far from Vienna wow =) so try them out!!",0x89b64d3909c20759:0xda887c7354075dcf,VA

They were kind of rushing to get the orders (because of being just 2 guys for the whole restaurant + online orders which is a common thing now a days...) But even so, they managed to give us a really good service and very good food.
We'll be definitely coming back here very soon and, probably, very often.

Food is more Americanized than traditional Japanese, but delicious if that's what you're looking for! Even basic rolls have good portions of fish, and rolls are good prices. Basic and special rolls all come with 8 pieces. We had their candy cane, earthquake, Alaska, and spicy salmon rolls. Out of those, earthquake was the favorite. Definitely try their house sauce on the rolls as well!!",0x89b64d3909c20759:0xda887c7354075dcf,VA

Their specialty is sushi rolls so for the people who like sushi rice(like my wife) this place is great! One difference in the rolls this place offers I personally really enjoy is the rolls are actually slightly warm, it gives a better mouth feel than the typical cold rolls you get elsewhere(disclaimer: I have not ordered rolls with raw fish so i dont know if those are warm as well) The environment  is clean and cozy, its another reason why my wife nags me to come back again and again lol",0x89b64d3909c20759:0xda887c7354075dcf,VA

The restaurant was clean and not crowded. The service, though I said previously was take away, was prompt. I placed my order online, and received a text as soon as it was ready, and it was ready before the estimated time. Very nice. I will be returning as often as my cravings call me.

2021-07-30 17:56:49.981,3,"I don't do sushi, but I like Japanese, so this is a review of some non-sushi items.

The gyoza were okay, but deep-fried instead of pan-fried, so it's a bit like having those frozen microwavable things from the grocery store. Hot and crispy, but all you taste is the shell.

The chicken teriyaki was not good. It has the basics you'd expect, chicken breast in a sweet brown sauce. But the vegetables they added seemed odd, at least to American tastebuds. I don't know what's considered 'authentic' for this dish, I just know that cherry tomatoes, cabbage, and edamame beans aren't what anybody else serves, and don't work together.

You get the usual salad, which had peanut dressing. I was okay with that, until I took a bite and realized everything had already been tossed with some sweet oil.

Somehow, even the rice had an issue. They serve it on some big (banana?) leaf, I guess for decoration. But the flavor of the leaf, which is kind of musky, bleeds into the rice. This was a problem with the gyoza too. I assume this is an accident, but it doesn't help.

I'm not normally nitpicky, but it's frustrating that nothing tasted like what I expect or hope for.

On the plus side, the decor is pretty good with lots of dark-stained wood, the service was great, and apparently people like their sushi.",0x89b64d3909c20759:0xda887c7354075dcf,VA

Their Sashimi is also fantastic, and they even threw in a free cheesecake. This is now our go-to sushi joint.",0x89b64d3909c20759:0xda887c7354075dcf,VA
2021-02-15 13:02:30.438,3,I'm not really sure how to describe my rating except that this place was the same price as other such places in the area and just wasnt as good.

We tried Boat #2 Combo to go and agree with some of the other reviews - the packaging quality is top-notch, which was a nice surprise. There were 4 different rolls and all were quite good. The -1 is for the sashimi in the dish. The fish was just ok, which is not unexpected for a normal local sushi spot in this area.

Now to rate the food. It was typical fare for the Smith Mountain Lake area...meaning it was only borderline edible and overpriced for the quality they delivered. Of the food my family and I got - the scallops were plain and slightly over cooked, the ‚Äúgrilled‚Äù shrimp were steamed (not grilled) and overcooked, the hush puppies were missing from one of the meals, the clam strip appetizer was barely enough to be called even that and tasted like it came from the frozen food aisle of the grocery store.

The people are friendly, the food is good and the place is mostly clean (has a few leaks when it rains).  So, what earned that seldom given 4th star?  The other options available within 20 feet of the counter.  This is a one stop family covered food stop.  You can grab convenience food and drinks or visit 4 different restaurants in a single venue.  If you don't want seafood, you can visit Pizza Hut, Arby's or Subway.  That's 4 top choice restaurants in a single location.  So, this review is more for Crewe Station than Long John Silvers.

2021-06-04 19:58:42.340,5,"I honestly can't say enough good stuff about this place! My wife and I had the kids out of town and so we have been eating out a lot this week. We drove around for about an hour trying to decide on a place and almost went to a few other locations before we decided on Main Street Sports...  We honestly just like to try new places so we just were making a roll of the dice.  The food was honestly out of this world!! The menu is very unique in that it has a good variety of seafood as well as hibachi items and a lot of other stuff including great appetizers!  Take a moment and check out the menu online‚Ä¶ you will see what I mean. I've been to every hibachi place in town including some of the very high dollar places and this hibachi food knock to the socks off of them all. The presentation, quality and flavor was so amazing.   My wife got the Shrimp Boil bag -  The only suggestion is that it maybe you could have used a little more seasoning or salt but all of that could have been fixed. I guess it's better than having too much seasoning in salt üòÜ  I took a screenshot of the current menu To help you understand the variety of the menu.

With the wings they only offer two types of seasoning Obay or Spicy Maple Carolina Reaper Pepper Ranch (yes that‚Äôs the whole name). They really recommended the 2nd option so I went with it and wasn‚Äôt impressed. It should have just been Spicy Maple and it wasn‚Äôt that hot. Wings were slimy just a no.

2019-07-22 21:56:17.413,1,"So, we ordered 2 Philly style sandwiches and 2 orders of 'Truffle' waffle fries.

I don't even know where to begin with what we were all unhappy about. So we ordered both of our 2 'philly cheese steaks' rare, because they asked us how we wanted it cooked. And both meats were overcooked, sad grisly meats, with very little almost-carmelized onion and a large fluffy white bread bun, with a sprinkling of provolone. We didn't get any horseradish sauce or at least not enough to actually taste it.

I will say the Au jus was tasty but the rest of the sandwich was trash.

Now the truffle fries, a joke at the very best, not a drop of truffle oil. It was all garlic and parm. So a total miss. The fries were also really hard. Not like crispy, which would be fine, but like stale almost. Really, the only blessing for the fries is that they were $4 a piece.

They also didnt run our food to the table. Some of the food trucks do, and if it were really busy, I would have said whatever, but it was monday and dead, and we were the only people that had ordered.

Should have just ordered a pizza to be delivered.

The fried shrimp was horrible. They were breaded in corn meal and was gritty. They swear they know what they doing tho.

2021-01-23 18:45:52.824,5,"Stopped here on my birthday after googling ""seafood near me"" while visiting richmond.   I'm from fredericksburg, so I was very excited to indulge in what the capital has to offer.   I was not dissapointed.   I had arrived about an hour before closing.  This establishment is at the end of a strip mall in the more interesting side of richmond.  I had seen that the sign read ""florida style seafood"" .  I wanted a more DMV style seafood establishment, but I was already here.   When I entered, I was promptly greeted.   Due to covid-19, the interior was rather barebones: no seating and a homemade lemonade stand.  I was very excited to be here.   This is exactly what you look for when ordering seafood from a hole-in-the-wall.   Their trays were displayed in a cooler and that gave a very good visual representation of what you got when you paid.  I got chicken tenders, clams, and shrimp , and sides .  My shorty got crabs and shrimp and sides. My card was declined because I forgot to transfer my stock money and the staff were extremely patient and understanding.   We were pleased with the customer service and the food.  Very impressed.  When talking with the cashier I was informed it was their first week of business, and I am proud to say that their kitchen is immaculate.  The food is good, and they aim to please.  If you go there looking for good food, you get good food.. out of towner's beware: leaving the parking lot someone was claiming I owe them money (I'm from a town 36 mins north) , see through these people and DO NOT give them the time of day.   Go about your moves never get tangled up with people like that down in Richmond üíØ.     Overall 10/10 :. Awesome food wonderful customer service.",0x89b117f70efa093b:0xd576a2d6b48edced,VA

I'm particular about my seafood and they didn't let me down. Short of being on the coast they prepare and present seafood very well. While had the Salmon and loved it, my friend had the fried cod, it was good as well. Many others that I saw seemed to love the crab legs.

They offer all you can eat. Notice .... Eat what you order, they charge you extra for food wasted. You won't want to leave anything.

2017-10-19 04:01:18.039,2,"Food is very overpriced. Though the food  does arrive well seasoned and very hot the seafood, in particular the snow crab legs,  were not fresh.  The meat was dried out in the shell and did not slide freely out when cracked.  Though all of the food is extremely pricey (some meals are $125+) the all you can eat option has increased in price from $39.99 to $49.99 and any food you do not (or cannot) finish is now weighed and charged $30/lb extra.   Of course sharing is not allowed and the owner watches you eat on hidden cameras to make sure that you don't (creepy).  I was very bad and gave my son a few mozzarella sticks and about 8 shrimp.  My husband sent back the cheesecake he ordered because it was flat, very dense, and dried out.  They used a stock photo on the menu that the actual item looked nothing like.  Because of the sharing thing the owner would not remove the dessert from the bill and no one told us this until we questioned it.  The owner wouldn't even come speak to us and it was relayed through the waitresses, one of which was rather snotty when queried.  Though we were completely in the wrong I felt it was handled very badly.  I would have paid for the food I shared but the way it was handled was unprofessional.  I feel like we can't  go back again anytime soon because of this.  I can't comment on how well/unwell their business is doing but in the 2 hours we were there there were only two other customers in the entire restaurant so I don't  really know whether they can afford to alienate customers.

As for the atmosphere,  the decor is better suited for Captain D's than for a restaurant where one dish can cost hundreds of dollars.  There are no fewer than 5 big screen TVs spaced around the restaurant set amidst netting, mermaids, and fake fish.  To cap off the tackiness of the decor there are 3 neon bubble wall panels seperating the bar area from the booth dining area.  The tables are covered in a sheet of brown wrapping paper from a roll.  This is not a place I would want to take a date for a special night out.  I can't quite  figure out whether they are going for a tacky seafood restaurant, a sports bar, or an upclass elegant restaurant (as indicated by the price list and 2 pound leather menus).

When we arrived back forty minutes later, the hostess told us excitedly that it would only be another 10 minutes and we could wait in the bar.  No seats in the bar, so we waited outside.  We were finally seated and had about 10 minutes to ourselves (before a server greeted us or took any order) to notice how dirty the floor, tables, walls, etc. were.  There was a family with two small children in the same room and we figured they had been waiting a while, so we decided to leave.

2021-05-19 19:00:19.373,5,"This place has soo much potential to be great! My first experience was good.

Pros:

The Bourbon list is great hard to find stuff like Midwinter nights Dram, Several Blood Oaths, and Eagle 10year were all nice to see available. Especially for the amateur whiskey collectors/lovers who can't sit outside the ABC 2 hours before open for a bottle of Blantons!

The cigar bar looks awesome. Not my thing personally. However I was very impressed by the humidor and selection. Should be cool once the cigar section opens.

Ambiance is really good. Fits the mood. I liked the live music although at times we felt like maybe it was a bit too loud for casual conversation over dinner and whiskeys.

Food. The food is good we enjoyed the meals that came out and the chef takes a lot of pride and care with his work.

CONS:

Staff/Training: Our waitress was so incredibly nice. I would consider myself easy to please however. For the menu pricing I am honestly expecting more experience with staff to be frank. I felt like I paid Ruth Cris pricing but had a TGI Friday's level of service. As well the staff could definitely be helped with some paid training learning about whiskey basics. Our staff didn't seem very knowledgeable about whiskeys.

The Drink Menu Tablet: Tons of drinks and I loved that however the tablet system felt clunky and I wouldn't bother if I weren't big on whiskey. I think printed Menus with some staple whiskeys like Buffalo, Blantons, Elijah Craig, Wellet, Willets.. etc. Would be nice and have the tablet system available on request. Also would love to see tasting flights!..

The Food Menu: I saw another review that was spot on. I would love to come here and just drink a couple nice bourbons not on my shelf at home regularly with some light appetizers. However the food is meal centric and I don't necessarily want to spend 50+ on a meal with a couple 20 dollar pours on a week night. I would love to see a more casual gastro bar style menu dips/some fried sharable options.

Hope to see this business thrive going forward!",0x89b6454cf7ffe4d7:0x1655901957b7a4be,VA

Drinks were good, service was good... At first. FOOD WILL MAKE YOU SICK

After I got home from eating at Steamers with my girlfriend I started experiencing terrible stomach pain and ended up on the toilet and throwing up for the next 2 hours.

About an hour after I got done my girlfriend began throwing up and having the same exact issues, so we knew then that it had to be the food we ate at Steamers.

I called the next day and talked to the Manager named Hector or Jose, or something. He said he would refund the money and take care of the situation.

After calling them multiple times for the past two weeks because the money never got refunded (every time they told me that they sent it through on their end and that it was my banks issue). I finally called my bank and they told me the refund was never issued.

So not only did my girlfriend and I get food poisoning but I got the run around and blatantly lied too. The place is just all around dirty and disreputable",0x89b719808e5b757b:0xba6075016a237eff,VA

I know it was new years eve but it made no sense people acting that way to me it was embarrassing i dont know why management did stop this kinda behavior. This is not the 1st time ive experienced a bad time at steamers. I will no longer go there i will spend my money somewhere else.

Beverages were reasonably priced, not many places that charge only a dollar for a bottle of water. This all came to about $10.

Sure, there was a 40 minute wait, but that's only because it's brand new.  It's also unique. I trust the store will adjust to larger volumes of customers in the near future.

Some pros would be the decor is on point, and the smell when you walk in is appetizering. The food lacks flavor though. I got the special menu crabcake but it lacks any spice or seasoning. 80% is just plain breading. 15% is grease.

The restaurant is gracious enough to offer blue crabs to go and they will steam and pack them for you with plenty of seasoning or butter on the side. For half a dozen, at this point in the season, I can usually grab 6 jimmies for $34. Since I cross over the JRB quite often, its hard to pass up an opportunity to hit them on the way over and bring back some crabs for pickin.

My husband and I went and the only positive feedback I have to provide is that the view looking out onto the water was nice and when we walked out to our car there were two cute alley cats that we gave some of our food to. Other than that, the service wasn't that great; a dish was never brought out and by the time we got our drinks we were almost done with our meal (mind you, our server only had 2 other tables). The seafood was probably the worst seafood I've ever had. It tasted like it was microwaved, was overcooked and had a weird soapy flavor.

On the plus side... Their shrimp prawns are great! Highly recommend the shrimp here and that, along with water, will probably be the only things I ever order here again.

The stuffed mushrooms were still raw and cold on the inside and they were completely waterlogged. The Shea crab soup smelled and tasted awfully similar to cream of mushroom with spices and crab meat in it. That came out lukewarm at best. The crab meat tasted previously frozen, which I do not mind but it tasted freezer burnt. If it was considered not Shea crab, it would be a good soup. The only good thing I tried was the fried shrimp with jalapeno, those were good.

If you're looking for Shea crab soup, not the best place for me but to each their own.  It is hand made there which I discovered when I bit into a raw clump of the roux they used to thicken the soup.

2019-05-29 22:44:05.939,1,"My experience was very small, but very bad. A friend recommended the Crab Shack and raved, saying they had a great meal and a wonderful time but unfortunately this was not my experience. I popped in for an app and a drink at about 3:30pm during the week (not prime time). The restaurant is **right** on the river at the foot of the Rt 17 James River bridge and had ample seating right on the water. The hostess was a sweet teenage girl with braces, and although it had kind of a touristy
vibe, it was very clean and gave a good first impression. I sat outside next to the water and asked if there were any happy hour specials. I was advised that happy hour is only at the bar, but no food specials for offered, but there were a few drink specials, so I decided to move inside to see what was on offer and it all went downhill from there.

The woman behind the bar was extremely rude and had a rough appearance and manner. Very brusque, didn't make eye contact, and just wanted to know ""what do you want"" without any explanation of choices. I like wine, but was disappointed in the wine by the glass options so I got a mixed drink ($8) which was fairly thrown at me in a rocks glass full of ice. If it was an 8oz glass there was possibly 2oz of drink in it. I'm not saying I was looking to get drunk at 3:30 in the afternoon, but I didn't feel like it was $8 worth of drink and the delivery left a lot to be desired.

Oysters Rockefeller arrived promptly,(5 for $9) but as soon as they came out I knew it was not something that anyone could or would eat. The oysters themselves were fresh  but the topping consisted of thick, brown, burned greasy spinach that had obviously been stewing in bacon grease and / or possibly fried on a dirty griddle... I don't know how many days old it was  but it was utter sludge and completely inedible. I asked for the check because I wasn't worth it to have a confrontation with the bartender. I think I read that situation pretty clearly because she didn't blink when she picked up the full plate of oysters from the bar in front of me. As she shovelled it into the trash without asking what was wrong, I asked, do they always come out like that? And she said yes. So if that's the case that's the last $20 they'll ever get out of me.

On the ride home I thought long and hard about the last time I was treated so poorly or served something so disgusting, but this was a new low. I'm over it now, but I was mad all the way home. I would never go back or recommend it to anyone else. If they can't even get a drink and appetizer right I'm sure as heck not going to gamble $50pp for dinner.",0x89b077e200b8d757:0xa34408610ee94f40,VA

The soft-shell crab is definitely worth it, but only seasonal (which makes sense).

2019-08-29 22:42:05.215,1,"Got the crabcake dinner and chicken sandwich, both were bland and under-seasoned. The service, however, was impeccable.

Also, the table next to us had a few young children and, sitting outside, they were of  ourse intrigued by the cats who lounge outside. Apparently they caused a small hole in the plastic screen, which is troubling, but what the owner did was more so. the owner came out and yelled at a child, leaning over another strapped into the baby seat, and when the mother went to intervene the woman turned on her and started berating the mother for not being a good mother and not teaching her kids to treat things with better care.

I can understand being upset, but the screen was a plastic screen, which could not cost $20 to replace, was it worth putting your face in the face of a child's and traumatizing those children over? She could have pulled the mother or father aside and said something, but directly yelling at a child wasnt right.

Dont bring your families here, with how she walked up and did it boldly in front of another couple dining here, it wouldnt surprise me if she has done this before and will do it again if something displeases her.",0x89b077e200b8d757:0xa34408610ee94f40,VA

It was clean and nicely decorated with nautical artwork.There were no introductions of staff or reccomendations. It seems to be a place that is more familiar with serving regulars than new customers. It would have been nice to know what the featured ""catch of the day"" was but it was disregarded. Although the crab cakes are homemade, the crab dip is ""from a can"" the waitress said when asked what type of crab it contains. I ordered the side salad but when it arrived, I was reminded by my husband that there is currently a warning for ecoli on spring mix and romaine. It was served regardless. Broiled crab cakes were delivered instead of the fried crab cakes ordered. They were not great and the rest of our group had similiar feelings about their dishes. When leaving the guy at the front did not acknowledge us while toweling himself.

2018-05-29 14:13:00.213,3,Good experience and location but a bit pricey for the value.

2018-12-12 04:01:30.712,4,I actually don't mind the wait so much at this restaurant because it is popular and you can't cook those Seafood items  too far in advance. So I have learned to be patient depending on what I order at restaurants. It is a popular spot. The food is always good to me. I love how it is presented. Love that I'm able to make a mess and nobody cares. I've never been disappointed here. It can be a little noisy at times and busy with people back and forth past your table. But  Crab Shack is not a five star steakhouse so I expect this and I learned to be a little more understanding. Once my food comes I don't care what's happening around me.

2016-07-22 05:33:40.662,3,"Went here a couple times, but never really had an experience that made me feel better than just okay. The food is deceit, but for the location you would imagine it should be a lot better then it is, unfortunately there is much better seafood option in the Hampton Roads area. This place might be on par with Joe's Crab Shack at best (not a compliment from my personal opinion).

On the bright side however, the staff was very polite and attentive and it didn't take long to get served after we ordered our food. It also has a beautiful location right on the James River, which at sunset makes for a wonderful setting! There's also a large pier near the restaurant that for a small fee you can fish and catch off of during the day.

Overall, the place has a lot of potential, and hopefully with time this place can become exceptional. In the end perhaps it's worth a try to experience it for yourself and make your own decision, I just caution you at this point in time there is much better seafood elsewhere in the area.",0x89b077e200b8d757:0xa34408610ee94f40,VA

2013-12-09 19:40:28.908,3,"The service here is god awful, but the food is actually pretty good.  I came here one Thursday night at the recommendation of a hotel concierge.  Upon walking in the restaurant, there was no hostess/waiter present.  I proceeded to go to the restroom came out and still no one was there to seat me.  Just for kicks I sat a timer to see how long I can wait up front.  I ended up waiting twenty minutes to be seated before a cook rounds the corner to go to to the restroom, sees me, then decides to get a waiter.  Her immediate response is to ask ""What can she help me with?""  I ask her are guest supposed to seat themselves at which she says no.  She was a little taken back.

Anyway I end up sitting at the bar and ordering the fish (flounder) sandwich meal with a beer.  At the bar I assume were 3-4 other employees who were currently off having inappropriate conversation about how much they drank and how messed up they were at the restaurant the other day.  After about 15 mins. my food arrives.  The fish sandwich was excellent with just the the right amount of seasoning at a decent size.  The house salad was also crisp and tasty.  I asked the bar waitress for some mayonnaise and she returns with a container of butter which she then apologizes for after I notify her.

Moral of the story, the food here is pretty great.  I would give it a 5 out of 5, but the service staff here is just pitiful",0x89b077e200b8d757:0xa34408610ee94f40,VA

2018-01-15 16:02:05.358,2,"I was disappointed.  This was my first visit in years.  So need I say I have become quite a food critic.  I so wish I taken pictures.   Presentation will always go a long way in my book.   I not only want my food to taste good but I also wanted to look good.  First oyster rockafellas should not be served stacked on top of each other on a small glass plate.  Try a sea salt presentation next tim.   I came there for the oysters not for the spinach so much spinach that I had to dig for the oyster no bearnaise sauce no hollandaise sauce just a glob of spinach.  Not very tasty either.  I also ordered blackened tuna bites ask for them to be just put on the grill and taken right off that means rare.  Not sure what they consider blackening spice taste it like someone put some Lowery's seasoned salt thrown  on the grill and brought it out to me on a plate shredded cabbage.  I sent the tuna bites back dry overcooked and no blackening seasoning.  The third item was fried oysters can't go wrong with those or can you due to the nature of the sizes the breading wasn't cooked all the way I experienced raw dough.
I really hope someone from the restaurant reads this review and next time someone sends a pate back to the kitchen takes they time to visit the table.",0x89b077e200b8d757:0xa34408610ee94f40,VA

2017-03-27 13:54:37.646,5,"Great little hole in the wall seafood Restaurant. It is a bit tricky to find, but when you find it you will never forget how to get back. It is located right before (or after) the Jame River Bridge that connects Hampton and Smithfield. The restaurant catches all of their seafood daily so the menu is subject to change based on availability. The Crab Shack is literally connected to the JRB fishing pier and you can see people fishing from where you are enjoying your food/meal. The restaurant also overlooks the Elizabeth RIver and the Hampton beach which can be quite calming.

SInce the restaurant shares a parking lot with the fishing pier, the parking lot is a bit confusing on who is a restaurant customer and a person who is fishing. Parking lot can be cleaner but more than likely the view of the water will distract any customer.

The staff is friendly and effective. The waitresses are knowledgeable and fun to chat with when you do not know what to order. Service is substantially fast considering the volume of customers they have seated at any given time. There is a small bar customers can sit at though it is a bit hidden. Pricing is a little steep. In this review, I had the Shrimp Dinner ($17) and I would have to say that it was less than impressive for the price.",0x89b077e200b8d757:0xa34408610ee94f40,VA

2021-05-10 22:59:15.451,3,"I decided I wanted chicken.  But I had ordered so much from KFC lately I decided I needed a change.  And I have heard good things about Popeyes from friends before.  So, I decided, why not order from them?
So I went online and found out I could order from many delivery services.  One was Doordash and one was Grubhub.  As I trust Grubhub a little more I ordered from them.  But I noticed that Doordash's delivery fee was smaller and while they still added to the menu prices, like 30 or 40 cents per items, it wasn't that pricey.  As I wasn't ordering a lot, in hindsight, ordering from Doordash MIGHT have been a better idea.  But let's move on with the review on POPEYES ordered via Grubhub.
I ordered a 3 piece Chicken Dinner (Spicy) with Red Beans and Rice, a Biscuit, and a large Diet Coke.
It got to me on time, after they did the change-the-ETA thing, and the driver was not only very polite but warned me about the lid on the drink.  It was cracked in two places and he suggested that Popeyes was using cheap plastic in their lids.  I thanked him for the warning.
The Diet Coke was cold, the somewhat small Biscuit was salty as heck, the Chicken Dinner (a leg, a thigh, and a wing) was meant to be spicy but I only detected spice on the thigh.  It was the GOOD level of spice - just adding enough heat without covering the taste - but it was only added to one piece.  And the Red Bean and Rice seemed to be mostly red sauce with some rice and, to be honest, invisible beans.  Because I don't think I found any.  Or I failed to taste them.  I even took a photo and can't tell if it had beans or not.  It felt like I was eating watered down soup.
Over all, for what I got, for how disappointing it was, and for what it cost I should have gone with KFC and ended up with a much better meal.
Update - Ordered via Grubhub because there was a deal.  Why else would I order from them?  And they got the order right.  Kind of?  The Spicy Chicken Sandwich was good.  The Cajun Fries and Coleslaw was good.  The Chicken Tenders were...sad and the Biscuit was salty.  But the Diet Coke was cold and at least they know what Sweet Tea is. Unlike McD's which seems to think sweet tea is weak soda. But Popeyes forgot all the sauces I asked for.  So maybe add a star to make the total three?  Still not impressed and wonder how this location is still in business.",0x89b7b3fcab424e3b:0x3e3a322411dadba8,VA

What are they training these people?  First off, you don't congregate in the front and talk while doing business. Secondly, you don't eat on the front line or in the view of customers while you're working. Third, you don't put you hands in your mouth while on the front line.

Wait staff wore their masks correctly,  and was wearing them correctly the whole time I was there.

Reviews stated as a ""hit or miss"" Red Lobster restuarant. Looking around the waiting room there was random pieces of trash on the floor near the Greeting guest station. What employees that passed by the trash ignored it. As well as VISIBLE dust and fingerprints on wood surface of guest station. Covid regulations in play, NO MASK NO SERVICE. Social distancing seating in waiting/ dining area.
When seated looking around the dining area was seemingly clean. Janoria was the server assigned to the section at the time. She is awesome, ""on the ball"" an asset for that Red Lobster. Everyone else looked and vibed as though they did not want to be there. Understandable to a point however Janoria rose above the negative vibe from her co workers. She was attentive and greeting even though our food seemed to take some time. However, it was hot and yummy except for the quinoa/ rice side it was dry and no quinoa was present, it was wild rice. The brussel sprouts are heavenly if you love this veggie. My Trio of salmon, lobster and shrimp was yummy. Worth the wait and price.

They didn't have any claw chops for the snow crabs had crack them with my teeth and they didn't even give me a slice of cake for my B-day. I had to paid for it. They didn't even sing happy b-day. I like going to the red Lobsters in the beach. They always give me slice of cake for free and sing happy birthday. But if this is the norm now at these restaurants now I won't be going back anymore. I understand there is a pandemic but life is also to somewhat to live. I turned 60 years old and I have always celebrate my bdays at Red Lobsters down through the years!!!! It's the little things that goes a long ways and make each restaurant's stand out from the rest!!!! Like I said the server was outstanding with all the stress he was under. Trying to take care all the customer's by myself until he got help but the service good had been a lot better since out check was over 100.00 plus!!!!!! I guess it's time to try something new now!!!!!!!!!üò£üò£üò£üò£üò£üò£üò£,0x89baa04d329b3027:0xaa43a8a533700685,VA

2020-03-08 01:09:03.727,2,"Customer service was terrible, first off everyone doesn't like raw broccoli. When my mother and myself placed our order we asked for soft broccoli not once multiple times. Well let's just say the broccoli was hard and had no seasoning on it, so the waitress stated she will get us another serving. After waiting for another serving (mean while our food is getting cold) the broccoli was still hard with only butter on it still no seasoning. So the waitress asked if we wanted another item mind you my mother already had a baked potato, so I asked for one she didn't want to order two or even mashed potatoes, so she told the waitress to just give her a credit on her side item and of course she responded with what I thought which was we can't do that because it comes with your meal, ""you get two side items with your meal"" so at this point I stopped another waitress and asked for a manager. The waitress not once come to the table and asked would you like anything else or can I give you a refill or nothing, not to mention we was seated with no silverware. I forgot to mention that part to the manager because I was already upset , the manager was very pleasant as well as the waitress but she was not a good server. Thanks to the manager we got a discount for horrible service. I will stick with my usual red lobster for now on.

However, lately, our dining experiences have been less than satisfactory with both Red Lobster and Olive Garden. I mention them, because I know they are ""sister restaurants"". Nevertheless, the taste of the food has become very generic and bland. The quality has become very poor. Such as cold crab legs, unbuttered bread sticks. Even the service quality has diminished. We've found ourselves waiting/ looking for our waiters. Basically, we have just stopped dining at either restaurant. Sorry. However, the restrooms are always very clean. So, that's good. #disgruntleddiner üôÅüëéüèº",0x89baa04d329b3027:0xaa43a8a533700685,VA

Seems as though it was prepared days in advance, and by someone who shouldn‚Äôt be in the culinary business if they can‚Äôt make a simple salad. My 10 year old sister could have prepared a better salad than whoever wasted their time trying. Sad. Y‚Äôall gotta do better.

Update: After speaking with management I received a  sincere apology and was given a gift card.

2019-07-16 18:39:35.481,3,"Red Lobster is a old chain restaurant that has provided better-than-average seafood. It is okay for family gatherings as long as you don't mind a loud background as there is very little intimacy in the arrangement and oftentimes large parties or special events are quite audible. Seafood is average to better-than-average. If you want better Seafood go to a mom-and-pop store or a higher tier chain such as Bonefish Grill
Wait times on average 45 minutes.",0x89baa04d329b3027:0xaa43a8a533700685,VA

2019-08-17 11:26:11.523,2,"I was trying to sample one of the new crab specialty dishes. I looked and realized not only did it not have the crab specialty dish, but the scallops on the skewer were not fully cooked. The manager came over and suggested she could bring the missing crab sauce and have the scallops precooked but it would take 7 minutes. I had to wait, but by then I needed to get it ""to go"".  Everyone else was done and ready to go.  Most concerning was after all the inconvenience, she didnt attempt to make any adjustment to the bill. The waiter was awesome and did all he could. In the end my daughter did not like the crab dip, but the rest of the food was okay. The famous biscuits are now half the original size and not quite as good in my personal opinion.  Likely the product of price cuts like everywhere else. They won't have to worry about me again.. this was another shot after another poor food quality experience I had with this reataurant.

Maybe it was because we went on a Thursday or maybe it's the Chesapeake Square location but we spent almost $200 and the food was horrible. My family ordered various plates and the only food items that were decent were the fried shrimp and cheddar biscuits! Even the lobster baked potato was horrible! The potato skin was cold and looked old, not crispy and fresh at all! My fish was broken and tasteless. This was not a pleasant experience and I was shocked that Red Lobster had degraded into a fast food joint. Thank goodness our server was NICE!

2019-06-04 13:32:58.838,2,"In my opinion the food at this place has really gone downhill over the years. Seems like they like to overcook everything at this location. Dry and chewy Lobster, dried out fish, and their breaded shrimp is just plain disgusting. Even their cheddar Bay Biscuits is half the size of what they used to be? It's a shame really because this used to be a good location to go have dinner, but that is not the case any longer? I don't know if it's just bad management or just bad Cook's? But after our last visit last week we have officially given up on them. We will no longer go there and pay top prices for low quality food!",0x89baa04d329b3027:0xaa43a8a533700685,VA

Over the many years we have had the endless shrimp they always ask what your next order week be as they serve you the one. We had to flag the waiter down to give him the next order.

Took her another 15 before drinks arrived... and only got 1 of the three drinks we ordered. Didnt see her again for 15 or more minutes to ask where our other drinks were. When food finally came (many other patrons who came after were served way before us) they brought my wife the wrong meal, forgot my sides. The manager made it right... but the server acted like she couldn't care less. When it came time to pay... she kept my card for a very long time. I had to walk the restraunt to find her to get her to swipe my card so we could leave.

2018-06-23 03:39:00.184,2,"So came to Red Lobster looking for a decent Friday night meal with the family.  Unfortunately, the overall experience was less than enjoyable.  Shalanta T was our server.  At first it seemed like it was going to be the meal we expected.  I was wrong. When the salads came out we had no rolls yet.  Ok no big deal baking might be a hair behind.  Then here comes the meal right after the rolls finally made it.  We spend most of our time passing plates around.  Ok.  Fine I will wait on myself. Just figured she had lost her 25% at that time.  So as we eat crab legs, we have been given no place to put the shells.  Time to get resourceful.  We fashon the roll basket into a catch all by adding napkins to the bottom. This was hardly enough for two orders of crab legs.  So let's talk about the meal.  Crab was extremely soggy from sitting down in the water. Some parts were cold. So got about half the flavor at that point and our hands were soaked the whole time.  Thank God for the corn.  It was spot on.  So we continue to eat and here comes Shalanta.  Slaps the bill down and says she will take it when we are ready.  No-do you need anything else, no-want dessert...just here and gone.  So I continue eating.  Approximately 8 min later here she comes. ""I'll just go ahead and take that from you"". Now mind you my hands look like I just birthed a whale.  I told her I hadn't even looked at it yet.  I got an ""oh.  I guess when your ready.  Can I take your plates?"".  At this point she just stands there with her hands outstretched.  She expects my family to hand her plates she can clearly reach.  I finally had enough.  I stood up and went to the men's room to wash up.  Mind you I went that whole meal with one cloth napkin.  No wet towelettes, no paper napkins, nothing.  So I figured I'd get washed up and find a manager.  Let them know what was going on.  After walking down the hall and back with no manager anywhere, I figured they have lost the opportunity to make it right.  I am tired of waiting on myself and I was leaving.  I gave them a shot.  Since no one was there to fix it.  They get this review.  Sad really.  Dine there with caution.",0x89baa04d329b3027:0xaa43a8a533700685,VA

2019-05-24 16:27:22.670,3,"This was my first visit here and I have mixed feelings. We came for lunch and we were the first ones there. The waitress was prompt and friendly and it didn't take very long for a food to get there. But as the restaurant fillefd the service slowed down and I saw two couples leave without being served. I ordered fish tacos and french fries. The fish tacos were okay although the fish was a little overdone and the cheese have been added and was melted already. I prefer to be able to add cheese lettuce and tomato separately after it's served. They also didn't have the option of fried fish, only broiled or blackened. While the french fries were very good there weren't many. Most restaurants serve you more fries and you can eat. My friend ordered the shrimp and chicken and she said it was very good. I tried one of her hush puppies and they are gold standard for me in a restaurant. The ones here were not that good. The other issue was the decor which was minimal at best. And the booth seats were much too low and not geared towards being able to comfortably reach your food. Overall I'm not sure I will be coming back.",0x89ba9f7bb942b63f:0x872c794d02fe58b1,VA

Me and a friend arrived at 6pm on a Saturday. The last time I visited, i came on a whim and the wait wasnt too bad, so i wasn't overly concerned about this trip.

We waited to be seating in a line outside of the patio area. I was dissatisfied that no one welcomed us until about 15mins of standing. I will give it to the staff that it appeared really busy and since I was with a friend we just chatted since we weren't in a rush.

The biggest room for improvement would DEFINITELY be the reservation/seating system. It appears that reservations(no matter what the time) trump's a walk-in customer. Everyone was directed to the line whether you have a reservation or not, but then staff ask everyone in-line if anyone had a reservation, and anyone who did were fast passed through the line. For example, we had a couple join the line who had a 630 reservation(they were early for the reservation, but we had been there in line for 15mins before they showed up and they were seated before us). It seemed disorganized and could be off putting for customers. If you prefer reservations, maybe that should be stated.

The most important thing for me was that the craving for crab legs was satisfied, I chose green beans and fries and the fries were mushy, but everything else was great.

Quarterdeck it will be my go to local seafood spot. But I clearly will have to make reservations so that I can be acknowledged in a better manner upon arrival.",0x89b7b6f5b1ee2249:0x7a0fa97db30b464d,VA

A neighborhood favorite, you can catch locals taking in the Nationals, Redskins and other hometown favorite teams, cheering their teams to victory.  While locals come here regularly, all are welcome as it is also a major point of curiosity for out-of-towners who are looking for a bite to eat. Far from standard pub food, amazing crab dip, fresh salads, and clam chowders are among the delicious fare they offer.  I must add that although they offer many food options including burgers, fries and the like, they are renowned for their seafood.  They offer 3 kinds of crab legs as well as a blue crab special (at market price).   They have a great bar with friendly bartenders that provide good conversation, service and music.  If you enjoy a quiet setting, you can sit in the dining area where they have a great number of tables, including options to eat outside year round.

2018-05-13 15:51:21.548,3,"(Translated by Google) (Translated by Google) However, the crabs were delicious. From around the shop I heard a lobster crackling sound with a hammer, this is also fun. Since boiling crab takes time to place an order, it is a good idea to order from the side. Would you like to change every time a beverage is renewed and the employee becomes empty? Easy to ask by asking.
In order of jumbo size, a crab is provided by about 18 cm (shell part). Two adults asked more than twenty, too much, so we brought the rest.

It was the worst food i have ever had in any restaurant, and I eat out all the time! The pork barbecue tasted like it was days old and warmed in a microwave,  the baked beans were out of a can and warmed up in a microwave,  the asparagus was rock hard, the tea tasted like sugared water, and no paper straws were provided. I will never eat here again and neither will my friends who were with me. I don't know what has happened. Maybe a new cook? Cutting back on quality?

2017-04-15 14:23:33.480,2,"First glance it reminds me of a little crab shack. It's definitely a tiny place had some cute fishing decor, and a ""holiday tree"".

The food was a no. The clams were dry, fries were soggy, the fried shrimp was actually good/average, and the mac and cheese well..... Let's just say it's like little shells covered in velveta baked in a dish and then just microwaved when needed. If I wanted leftovers I wouldn't have stayed home and looked in my fridge.

I waited forever to even be offered a refill, and once again I only had water (seems to be a thing in the Luray area). The specials aren't special or a money savor.

The dessert was probably the best part and we ended up getting it to go because I couldn't take the waitress anymore. It was a lemon raspberry cheesecake. And it had like a cake/fluff layer on it and a whipped top.

After all this though I don't really suggest it. What is great to locals is sometimes just average to travelers.",0x89b44dd9a93f8699:0x3b36ee011e635c88,VA

As far as I could tell, they only had two people working in the dining room, which was about half full.  It took a while, but I got a menu, and ordered.  The bartender was friendly, but inattentive.  His lack of help in servicing the restaurant clearly did not improve the experience though.  I ordered the ravioli formaggio, cheese ravioli with a sage sauce. It's stated clearly in the menu cheese ravioli (its under vegetarian dishes on the web site), I mean, formaggio is Italian for cheese, how can you go wrong.  The bartender clearly stated to the cook what I wanted (I heard him say it)  I got the Caesar salad.  My salad was made promptly, but sat in the window for a full ten minutes.  They brought bread, which helped, The salad was good, as was the bread.  The Cheese ravioli ended up being meat though.  The server apologized, and said it comes both ways (cheese and meat) this is not true to the menu, but unimportant.  When he asked what I assume was the manager in the kitchen, it was met with a gruff response, that ended in my server saying he'd pay for the mistake, which he never really made. Whoever the thug who is who  threatens servers into fearing for their jobs over a kitchen mistake  needs to get a reality check and learn how to staff a restaurant, and how to treat their employees. The food is good, the method is good, they will fail if they keep with the current style.",0x89b112349e91e749:0xee92ec70eeb3b3a2,VA

So I was in the restaurant business, so I COMPLETELY understand that things happen and it's not always under your control. So I called to try to see if I could figure out what I could do because things were wrong and it was not enjoyable at all. When I called and asked to speak to a manager, an obviously angry person named Mike answered the phone with an indistinguishable statement; I guess the name of the restaurant no hello, no name, no nothing. I asked can I speak to a manager, please and got a ""she's not here."" answer.  So I asked ""Ok who do I talk to about a messed up order I just received. He said, ""Oh, Did you order it through Grub Hub?"" I was like yes then he said, ""well I got to go to the computer, hold on."" very matter factly. So I was like ok?? Then when he came back, he started reading off the order to me, and I confirmed that was my order. I had the distinct feeling that he has had a lot of problems with GH in the past because he DID NOT WANT to deal with me. So then he was like ""so what's wrong?"" I asked him does the Steak Sub basic come with onions? And he says yes. But if you look at the menu which is on GH it DOES NOT state that, and it EVEN gives you the option to add onions. So one would assume that they would not be on them. When I told him this, he was like well it's on here. LIKE I AM AN IDIOT! This was when I hung up.

The subs were horrible; the bread was soggy, the meat had NO FLAVOR to it at all. My wife DOES NOT LIKE onions so that would be why we ordered the basic so none would be on there. That's what the ONLY MENU I had access to MIKE, said.  There were Very little meat and Very little toppings. The beard was very stale and old. And YES you can tell that I have been in the restaurant business 25 yrs, my wife over 30. The bread was very old and stale.

I Love Calamari especially Fried Rings. I eat them where ever I go. It typically does not have a heavy fishy smell to them, they do a little bit but when they smell heavy fishy bad, throw them out. Well, these had a very pungent smell of fish, bad, under-cooked and very poorly prepared. Yes I did try one and it almost made me throw up.

Overall I will never go back and would not recommend ANYONE trying it.

2020-10-19 01:48:41.361,5,Ate here with the family for lunch. We had calamari for appetizers and it was good. Calamari was perfectly fried. Seafood boil was delicious and I chose the boil that combined all the sauces in them. Our waitress was patient and very informative about their menu.

2020-11-30 20:55:47.270,3,First time trying this place out and the service sucked. Our server seemed out of it and we had to ask for crab crackers which should have been a no brainer.

2019-06-28 23:37:55.094,5,"I'm giving this place 4 üåüüåü üåüüåü mainly because we were totally surprised, in a really good way. We'd been here several years ago and it was just meh...nothing special. We drove by last year and it looked closed down. Being on the Northern Neck, there's only a hand full of decent restaurants. We thought we'd give Leadbelly's at the Fairport Marina another look-see because we heard it WAS open.  Glad we did!

Nothing fancy. Nothing. It's a Marina. You can smell the sea lingering from the work boats docked there. There's outdoor screened porch seating, but it was closed ""due to extreme heat"". The waitresses wear t-shirts advertising the restaurant...and they wear flip-flops...probably against code, but what the heck.

There were 4 of us. I ordered the fried oyster appetizer ($12) with a side of fried cabbage ($2.25) My dinner mates each ordered the oyster platter for $20 which came with 2 sides and ""big butt rolls"".

Now...we've been going to another place where the oysters are tasty, but the portions have shrunk over time. When our friendly waitress (who grew up on the water and didn't eat seafood) brought our meals, I was pleasantly surprised at the huge mound of oysters. They had just the right amount of breading and the fried cabbage was delicious, cooked just right.  I forgot to count how many oysters I had,  but I know this: I got a big mess (a whole lot) of plump fried oysters for not a lot of money. My buddies had more on their plates than I had for the appetizer portion and they couldn't finish...they toted the remains home.

I pulled the shrimp out of the bag after eating the first one.  In the bag, all I tasted was heavy garlic on everything. I asked for butter sauce but neither the waitress nor the menu says anything about minced garlic.  They had no limes for the beer, the corn was tough, and the music was not interesting.  I am not going back and will not be sending anyone I know there.  I'll have garlic seeping out of my pours for days.

2018-10-02 19:53:54.812,1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY! I ordered the Snow crab lunch special (1 cluster, 1 side and a drink) for $11.99. I also ordered, 1 lb of jumbo shrimp ($12.99), corn, sausage and potatoes ($5), all with spicy cajun seasoning. I'll start with the good...The jumbo shrimp were good, crisp and cooked properly but could have been seasoned better.

If I could have written this review with 0 stars I would have. EVERYTHING else was HORRIBLE! The owners clearly opened this establishment having never been to a ""boil -n- bag"" style seafood restaurant and have no concept of the flavors/seasonings they should be using or have available. I received an extremely overcooked  rubbery set of legs with a cluster the color of Scrapple. The potatoes shown on the menu as red potatoes were potatoes wedges. FRIED FREAKIN POTATO WEDGES!! The sliced sausages were gray and the corn cobs were so overcooked they looked like someone had given the kernels a relaxer.

I called the server over to ask what kind of sausage this was supposed to be and why it was gray. She said ""I think it's beef and chicken."" üòë I said in the nicest possible way that I was not happy with any of the items I had ordered outside of the jumbo shrimp and for those I would gladly pay. The server took the bag to a man I assumed was the cook whom proceeded to turn and twist the bag inspecting the contents for the issues he already knew the food had.

The couple then attempted to tell me that snow crab is always gray in color because it's frozen. The ""cook"" states that he purchased all the crab at the same time so he knows it's good and there is meat inside. The server raised her voice telling me that the meal I received is the way it's done. I actually had to tell her to calm down because she was getting a little too passionate about her lack of food knowledge and less than desirable food quality. According to her, the people of New Orleans and every other fusion restaurant around the country have been doing it wrong.",0x89b6f8d84317f759:0x889c4274dbcb831,VA

I used to take my mom and cousins here when my mom and I visited Pulaski to see some of our family. They really aren't that bad. The food is always good and quite tasty.

There is a problem I saw on my last visit here though. Just as another reviewer said, they will put customers on speaker phone. You can hear all the customer's credit card information and everything. That is very dangerous and they need to watch out doing this. Never have I seen this anywhere but here. I told them they should never do that again. Hopefully they won't.",0x884dfc48cfe3efc7:0x3d8f3b5c098dd070,VA

My husband and I heard everything, and by everything I mean the order, credit card numbers, expiration date and all. She had a slight attitude for the customer and us, like she didn't care.
If this is how China Wall has evolved, I am not coming back.

2017-11-15 22:54:24.384,4,"We drove up from Virginia Beach. I was wanting fresh fish, and something other than fried. This place did not disappoint us. We were early so seating was immediate. Our waiter was very prompt, informative and engaging. The view of the ocean and pier was super. I ordered the swordfish, broiled. It came with a baked potato and seasonal veggies. My wife had crab cakes. Both were amazing. This place is a good value, IMHO.",0x89baecb1a5cbc4c7:0xa74d2b3d3d6f3ab1,VA
2017-08-15 00:04:29.569,5,"My wife and I went there last night with my Father for dinner. When we arrived, we were greeted at the door by friendly staff of the restaurant. I was impressed since these days no one displays old school etiquette.  We ordered appetizers and she crab soup...the soup was delicious (although it needs a bit more crab in it). The calamari was tasty and not greasy like other places I've visited. The main course was OUTSTANDING...Halibut on a bed of risotto with pesto and fresh grape tomato's. I was totally pleased with the service from Tom, too. Professional waiter staff...not dinghy kids with piercings and bad attitudes. I'll be back soon.",0x89baecb1a5cbc4c7:0xa74d2b3d3d6f3ab1,VA
2014-09-29 19:04:06.774,5,"Our Uncle used to take us here ""in the old days"".  We were pleased that it is still apparently very tightly run, and the staff is very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is lovely, and many tables have nice views of the bay and pier. (ask for reservations?)

We made it easy on the waitress:  four fried seafood platters all around.  (not adventurous, I know, but this is what we came for : )    Everything was perfectly cooked, including the large scallops (which were about the best I've ever had).

There was a good selection of local and regional craft brews which we appreciated also.

One of us got dessert, the raspberry sorbet.  It was actually phenomenal, and its presentation was brilliant too.

It was nice to be back here after so long. Thanks Lynnhaven Fish House!",0x89baecb1a5cbc4c7:0xa74d2b3d3d6f3ab1,VA
2012-03-10 04:18:33.513,3,"We had a mixed experience tonight. Most everything we had was great, and the server was wonderful. However, our entrees were sub-par. The Lobster, although tasty, was extremely tough; and the King Crab Legs, in the same respect, had a very dry rubbery texture. If you know anything about cooking seafood, both of these things happen when you overcook. We came at an off time, so I'm wondering if this is just a case of a bad chef. The appetizer, and all other food, were great... but when you spend $30 dollars for an entree, it better be perfect. I would honestly give this place one more shot to change my mind. In terms of value, it would have been justified if the food was flawless - but it could be considered a little pricey.",0x89baecb1a5cbc4c7:0xa74d2b3d3d6f3ab1,VA
2017-03-26 22:11:12.913,5,"One of best seafood dining experience with an awesome ocean view,no less. The food is succulent.  Again, this is a great place for food & dining experience. The she crab soup is a fabulous starter. The street view of the restaurant does not match the indoor presentation...looks like a common fish camp from outside. I would go again for a special occasion. Food quality is comparable to Catch 31 in VIB but without modern ambiance.",0x89baecb1a5cbc4c7:0xa74d2b3d3d6f3ab1,VA

They have everything you need to fish or crab there if you need it or bring your own gear and bait and just pay the small fee to access the pier for the day. Other people fishing/crabbing there are always really nice and the Fish & Game Warden even stopped and gave my boys some quick lessons on telling male/female crabs apart, when best to catch them, etc.",0x89baecb1a5cbc4c7:0xa74d2b3d3d6f3ab1,VA
2016-06-20 00:19:42.354,1,"Restaurant is very dated to say the least. I've been an off and on guest for nearly 20 years and this place could use an update. First the decor is antiquated in terms of modern dining experiences. The waitress put a piece of paper on the table which listed the ""catch of the day"" which demonstrated that she didn't take the time to learn the fish. The paper was crumpled as it came out of her tattoo-laden arm. Next the bathroom was absolutely filthy. My wife exited the restroom with our daughter covered in soap and water due to the dysfunctional dispenser. There was toilet paper and feces on the floor. The food was super par to say the least. The only thing that has changed in the past two decades are the elevated prices on deep fried seafood. When you go, you pay a premium for the view, location, and name. The service, atmosphere, and quality of food are terrible.",0x89baecb1a5cbc4c7:0xa74d2b3d3d6f3ab1,VA

On top of that the food was horrible.. What was crazy the had the nerve to rush us on the ordering meals and rush are check . Granted who know the restaurant close at 9pm.

The table beside us smelled of money and was very snotty. The waiter was bowing down to them but the man gripped about everything. The one lady did but not as much. However, he was on top of their every move. Working hard for that tip. As for Us, we asked for butter couldn't get that & we even had to wait for drink refills. It appeared he couldn't handle the work load and he was even sweating. Even the guy at the entrance didn't give two cents about us. We have never been so insulted in our lifes. We was spending money just like the other guests.

New Review 12/28/2016. The seafood tower has a new tomato puree something on top. Way to acidic for the delicate crab and shrimp. I much prefered the original orange creamy sauce. Also missed the pretty ripe slice of tomato on the bottom. Probably will not order again. Just too bitter. Please change it back! It was perfection! Now not so much.

Their Thai ice tea tasted sweet, fantastic and refreshing. I also really enjoyed their curry. The sauce was great and it was hot and fresh. It had a lot of onions in it though. We got a great view from our seat which was by the window. The dessert was good too.

Creme Brule was smaller than we thought but it was nice and soft, and not too crispy on top which is good. Their mousse was more of a chocolate cake though. The servers were very friendly. We had an enjoyable experience here after we swam in Colonial Beach. It‚Äôs worth going a little out of the way for.",0x89b73d3d42524ff3:0x1e59abbe7228f605,VA

2018-10-05 23:37:05.851,1,"(Disclaimer they serve undercooked seafood) So I'm revising my review, I had given them 5 stars before. They recently changed management and completely changed their menu.  If I could give 0 stars I would.   Several items were not available the night we went.  Took a very long time for food to be ready. Normally I don't care if I wait a little bit as long as the food is worth it.  This food was definitely not worth it. The only thing that saved the fried catfish was the cajun sauce, extremely bland without the sauce.  The ""stuffed"" shrimp were undercooked. Even if they were fully cooked they only had been stuffed with some kind of pesto style French seasoning, no crab like we were lead to believe.

Dinners we had were,.....
Ny strip
Scallops
Shrimp
Mahi Mahi

Owner that was drinking fix to the problem was get ya another drink and not tell you until you get the bill you were charged for it .

Drinks way overpriced!!!!!

The owner also wanted to shoot tequila shots like old friends, lol. After bringing the drink charges to his attention.

No one was drinking tequila!!!!! We were not there to get drunk!!!

Somehow we were served two Thai iced teas. For the price the food is merely average. They display a huge board of specials which makes you wonder how well they can really cook each and every one. The place has always been empty when we go and I can see why. Mediocre service and food at a premium price. Great presentation for the dishes though is about the only upside.

I think I'd much prefer to give my money to Suki The Cuisine than return to the Lighthouse. The service there is far superior and friendly. And the food has always been great.",0x89b73d3d42524ff3:0x1e59abbe7228f605,VA

Like Seaside, we had not been to The Lighthouse in over four years. As we pulled into the parking lot we saw the marquis sign, ""Now serving French & Thai""! The best of both worlds; an amazing chef, an amazing host in an amazing location on the water.

2017-11-24 03:23:19.691,1,Went for Thanksgiving dinner and the service and meal were atrocious. Soup came out cold and didn‚Äôt get a new one until after everyone else at the table had finished theirs. The entrees came out cold as well. Had to serve myself drinks because our server (Mike) was nowhere to be found despite only having two tables. The only time he actually checked on us was at the end of our meal. He spent more time taking about hunting than providing decent service. We will never return to this place. Even the manager who came by apologize was clearly over his head. He forgot our drink order as well. Poorly run establishment and low quality cold food. Stay away from this place.,0x89b6481f36900667:0x91373e2a7a86d693,VA
2017-09-15 23:03:37.345,4,Good service and decent food. Not the best steak I've had but not the worst either. Sitting outside on the patio listening to the live music was nice. Would be a good place to come for drinks in the evening.,0x89b6481f36900667:0x91373e2a7a86d693,VA

2016-03-04 19:43:50.892,1,"This place was god awful in terms of service and also pretty bad for choices that didn't have beef in them.

Our server was super creepy, he would stare at us with no indication if he was hearing our order, and then after we were done dictating our order he would continue to stare me down. When returned with our order of wine, he gave my wife and me two very noticeably different glasses of wine; the kicker here is that after we told him, he came back yet two more completely different glasses of wine. Aside from that, he was rarely to be found if you needed help and when he brought the food (I had observed him moving about the whole restaurant with our dishes in hand) it was stone cold and quite gross due to the temp. Then when we asked for the check, he charged us for a whole bottle of wine and 4 glasses of wine that were not the same as the whole bottle. The bottle of wine was stricken from the bill but not the glasses, and also no one apologized for the error.

I can honestly say I will never come back nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone.",0x89b6481f36900667:0x91373e2a7a86d693,VA

2016-04-04 17:48:20.263,4,"Brunch review.

Food : Good
Service : Meh
Live music : Great
Atmosphere: Depressing :-/

The menu looked great, while I prefer a buffet for brunch the drink menu was original here and the food descriptions looked like original takes on the classics. I'm all about more options for brunch in the suburbs and this place has a lot of potential. In my opinion, wait staff should be trained more, quality checks done on the food, and then it'd (maybe) be perfect! There were only 4 groups of people including us in the entire restaurant for brunch at 12, so that was kinda sad :-/ but the food did come super fast.

Steak and Scrambled Eggs: Decent, not great, not bad. Just Meh.
Hot cinnamon rolls: only $1.00 for 4 of these delicious hot cinnamon rolls- no sticky sauce just like fresh made donuts! Highly recommend- try one without butter first.
Oatmeal Br√ªl√©e: this was really tasty. I don't think it was healthy but I don't think that's what they were going for- this dish was a big bowl and really good.
Two sunny side up eggs: this is hard to mess up but one of my eggs came to me broken open already.
Side of toast: this was like jumping hoops here, apparently they don't ""do"" toast. But they attempted to fulfill my request for whole wheat toast by serving me rye toasted bread. While this will do the trick the issue was it came BLACK, like burnt black. 1) seriously? And 2) are there no quality checks being done at all before food is presented?

The service was maybe what to expect at M&S grill but we were still a little shocked. Sauce was poured on steak without the inquiry of wether or not we were even interested in the side sauce. Dishes were removed in the most uncouth manner, knives kept falling all over the place, and he laughed and apologized. Butter dishes from the appetizer of (yummy) cinnamon rolls were left sitting on the table for the duration of the meal. While the waiter poured water he didn't think to look at what he was doing so a giant group of ice cubes spilled over into the cup, causing water to go everywhere. And the waiter served burnt toast. Why would you serve burnt toast?

The lives blues music was really good! But they did stop playing half way through.

I say try it for yourself, you may love the brunch drinks and unique menu! As for us I think we'll stick with other RTC Brunch spots.",0x89b6481f36900667:0x91373e2a7a86d693,VA

2017-11-07 22:34:20.080,3,"To start i want to say the food was very good. We did not have an excellent experience in the area of customer service though. We went for the veteran's day event. It was advertised as a free meal for active duty, veterans, and gold star family members (parents and spouse). I am currently active duty and I planned to attend with my spouse, but on arrival when I asked, they said no just the servicemember gets a meal contrary to what was advertised on the giant sign I was standing right next to.  I appreciate when restaurants try to do something to give back, so I didn't press any further into it and I just ended up paying for the food. However, it makes a very bad impression to advertise one thing, but not follow through on the offer. If you only want to give this benefit to the serving member, advertise it that way. Besides that, the waiter for our table was very inattentive and failed to bring our drinks on time and didn't bring out the bread until we asked and even then we didn't get it until after our meal arrived. The place was not busy whatsoever at roughly 1 pm on a Sunday. They were open outside their normal hours for the veterans day event.

2016-06-08 20:57:41.730,1,"My wife and I went to M&M for our wedding anniversary, and we spared no expense. We purchased everything that we were interested in trying and eating and got a very nice bottle of wine on top of it. We had a great evening.

Unfortunately, that great evening turned sour when we got food poisoning from something in our meal (most likely from the undercooked bacon wrapped shrimp). Within two hours of leaving the establishment, we were both struck with stomach pain followed by vomiting and diarrhea. The demon was expelled, but We had not shared a single meal for three days before that evening so we know this is where it came from.

When we made a complaint, we were assured that it would be taken ""very seriously"" and there was no need to return our food as evidence. ""That won't be necessary"" we were told. So we threw it away. Why would we keep hundreds of dollars worth of possibly tainted food?

Expecting some kind of refund for our horrible experience, we were offered a non-committal 'dinner-on-us' with no specifics on what that entailed. My wife was understandably not interested in going back. We've called back a few times now and it has been several weeks, but we have not heard from anyone in management.

It seems they do not take such accusations very seriously at all, despite their initial claim. The only thing they've managed to do is drag this ordeal out so long that we've missed any opportunity we may have had to dispute the charges with our credit card company.

They pulled me forward to wait for fresh french fries that I didn't ask for. I told them at the speaker what sauces I wanted, they told me to tell them at the window. Let's just say they chose BBQ sauce for me on my receipt even though I asked for buffalo. Overall, its still a hot mess as of May 30th, 2021. People shaking their head at you when they are going the wrong way in the parking lot was fun. Also, expect people to double stack cars preventing you from leaving with your food.

The moment we walked in my family and I felt the warmth of the atmosphere.
The waitress was superb and so friendly!
The food was exquisite!
I ordered the softshell crab sandwich.... Which at first I was underwhelmed with what it was... deep fried softshell crab in between a couple of bread slices.
She told me to add a little mustard... And that's it.....When I bit into it.... The flavors exploded in my mouth. I couldn't believe how good something so simple tasted.

My wife had the fish and chips, which she said was the best she'd had.

I highly recommend it!

2018-06-15 02:05:41.040,1,"Nice location, food was ok, but wow, was the service non-existent.

We arrived and waited for several minutes as there wasn't a hostess at the front to greet guests.  Once seated, we waited for over 5 minutes for a server to approach is to see if we'd been helped.  It wasn't long till plates started piling up and not a server to be found again.  To make matters worse, we found out after being seated and told of the night's main items, ribs and steak.  If ribs and steak are the main meats, how do you run out at 7pm on a Thursday night?

Most items on the bar were fairly low as well.  While we were there, we saw at least 3 cooks standing around the back, 2-3 ""managers"" walking about and at least 5 or 6 servers.  As you can see in my attached photo, everyone just stood around ignoring the customers.  Our bottle of water at the table ran out early on after the initial fills, and we never were asked about a refill.  The table was bussed once during that hour.  Finally, we had to ask for our check after waiting for way too long to try and get anyone's attention.

All this would normally be overlooked, but there were only 6 seated tables inside and another 4 outside.  To have so many staff on hand not paying attention to tables as very poor customer service.  To run out of the main items on a slow night is very poor planning.  For the price, I can think of many other places to go instead.

2019-12-27 18:29:16.758,2,"I was not at all impressed with the Christmas Eve dinner buffet here. It was disappointing because I've looked forward to trying it out for years.

I spent over $200 for 4 people here and was not impressed with the selection, service, and food quality.

First, the salad bar was sad sad sad. Only 4 or so toppings to choose from, four salad dressings, and one type of not so fresh greens mix. There was a nearby ""cheese bar"" but I wouldn't call it that.... bunches of cheese on a tray that looked like from a Walmart platter with no plates or crackers or toppings is not that great.

The raw bar was probably the nicest element - a large bar with shrimp, salmon, and fresh raw oysters on ice. The shrimp and salmon were very good and my dad and boyfriend enjoyed the oysters, I don't eat them raw.

The hot food sections were equally disappointing. No steak, chicken, or prime rib. They did have some absolutely delicious and moist turkey at a carving station with gravy. That was very good. They had fatty beef and fatty brisket smothered in BBQ sauce. The sides were very dry roasted potatoes, bland corn with bacon pieces, Brussel sprouts and roasted bacon squash topped with a small piece of cheese and a cranberry. The squash was the standout. Nearby they had some rolls under a heat lamp - white and sweet potatoes. Often out of plates, no butter for a long period of time and when it did come out, it was frozen solid. A HUGE pet peeve of mine at a ""fancy"" place. Butter should never be frozen to be spread on bread. Ever. The rolls were hard and tasted like they were made a week ago, also, not warm. My boyfriend's 11-year old daughter commented they were like dog biscuits. I couldn't agree more.

The dessert bar was disappointing as well. I hoped for this to be the highlight. It wasn't. Several selections like cheesecake, bread pudding, chocolate cake, a peppermint swirl cake and Christmas cookies were ""laid out"" on a table outside the main buffet hall. Again, no plates, no refills of the items at the end of the night, they just ran out and it never got refilled.... the cakes were not moist and they were bland and tasteless with cheap whipped icing. Also, with no management the table was covered in crumbs and children and teens were sawing at cakes that were not pre-portioned or sliced to try to pick them up with tiny utensils. I even struggled... it was not well managed and was poor display and delivery of this.

The coffee and tea were good.

Service was OK. They were polite but continuously told us they were working Christmas Eve and were tired. We were also chastised for placing our own plates on the nearby tray to bus our tables despite the fact they weren't around to collect them and we needed to clear room.

Overall, not worth $200. I will not return.",0x89babdc36f510acb:0x67834faa4b3cd0a3,VA

They had one server, one hostess/bus girl and one bar tender/cook!!! The service was beyond slow. We saw our waiter 3 times. When he took our order, dropped off the appetizer and when he dropped off the entrees. We wanted a second adult beverage but no one came to check on us and ask how we were doing the entire time. The food was less than mediocre and everything tasted frozen. And then there it was, the bathrooms, I have never seen anything like it. The picture explains it all.

It wasn't too busy which was a good thing because this had our server extra observant on when we needed a refill. The hush puppies were tasty and I liked the steamed shrimp over the fried, but my hubby liked the fried shrimp over the steamed, to each his own I guess! Now, as for the crab legs, they were large legs and came out hot, however, I believe they are kept in the pot to stay warm which caused them to be slightly over cooked and the shell to become soft and a lot of liquid. All in all still pretty good. Waiter was super friendly!!! I would definitely return.",0x89b64eecc655e20f:0x60e248999227af2,VA

If it was it was way past its prime date.  So I ordered a Miller light,  tasted exactly the same.  Two stars given only because the staff was definitely  friendly but if you advertise a certain beer it better be that beer.

The first plate I ordered had hair on it and came with very very cold crab legs doused in Old Bay seasoning. The shrimp were as plain as can be, both the regular and fried shrimp.

The floors are bare and there is still paint splatters on the walls but no signs they are actively renovating.  Fine, we just decide to sit down and have a beer and find out that ALL of the taps are not working! So, we are reduced to drinking bottled beer; what do they carry? Basically every crappy beer possible (Bud, Bud light, miller light, mich ultra, Yuengling being the only bright spot).

We hoped the Pin-ball machines would be a bright spot, but 1 out of 6 of them was turned on.  Obviously just a crude ploy to get people to come in.  A side-gripe of mine was that on their wall of DC sports icons, they also have a huge picture of Kobe Bryant. Fail.",0x89b64eecc655e20f:0x60e248999227af2,VA

We had a reservation for fifteen to 20 people, about 8 of us ordered the seafood platter, after we placed our order they came back and told us there were no crab cakes. Okay no crab cakes that sucked, they allowed us to substitute the crab cakes for fish or chicken tenders. Not to mention the fish and chicken tenders did not come out with our meal. Next I waited 25 minutes for a cocktail at the bar the bartender never showed up. All the bartenders were in the back cooking. We placed an order to go for a steak and cheese, however, they messed up or misinterpreted and prepared a chicken cheesesteak and refused to give a refund!! Who does that? After they made us go home and get the credit card to do the refund, they still wouldn't refund us on a messed up order. What a waste!",0x89b64eecc655e20f:0x60e248999227af2,VA

2019-04-19 23:40:27.306,1,"This place has good food. Really! However, the couple that runs the place. Are very rude. They will get nasty with you at the drop of a dime. On the menu they have a list of things. I went in on a Tuesday afternoon . I asked for a catfish sandwich. She begins to walk away and say we don't have bread you can't get sandwich. Only meal. That she hasn't been to the store yet. You could clearly see the sandwich rolls on some type of counter. She will tell you this quite often. So you can't go in and ask for a sandwich. Also. They don't open as their signs say they are open. They literally open when they want to. I'm finally in here again because I have to say that the food is good. However the menu on the wall says 6.50 for #3 catfish. But tells me 7.50 ... I say that you know your menu says 6.50 right. She replies yes I not change yet. If this lady treated customers good. This would be a damn good business. But she treats ppl like hurry up and buy. UPDATE 4/19/2019 guy comes in waits in line for well over 15 minutes to place his order. Menu states 15.00 1lb of scallops. The guy says, he wants a half pound of scallops. The lady says you want half pound, 10.00 dollars. The guy says that's not what the menu says. She says you pay if you want it. The guy says you're ripping me off, I'm not paying that. She takes another guys order. And ignores the guy that was trying to order. He gets mad and leaves and knocks everything off the counter. To be truthful, this place does have good food. But very terrible customer service. Very unprofessional.

I went for the all you can eat catfish and was a tad disappointed with it being catfish fingers versus the filet. Pretty long wait (30+ minutes)for all you can eat which typically you would have a buffet and eat immediately. At least it was cooked to order. The fries were tasty but a tad greasy. They were nice enough to substitute that for some mac and cheese which was pretty decent. The catfish was very fresh, and hot, I would love to see if they serve fillets on Friday. I rarely ever eat catfish, but had to try an AYCE fish joint. Very modest spot and they do the best they can to take care their customers, and make sure that they are satisfied.

2019-05-17 19:42:57.933,4,"I absolutely love the food here. You will find things that no other restaurant in the area offers. Fried green tomatoes, Corn nuggets, fried mushrooms etc. They aren't your typical fried mushrooms, they are fresh with very little breading, more like a tempura batter, excellent!  Fried green tomatoes are also lightly breaded and melt in your mouth, but the corn nuggets - - - I've never had them anywhere else, they are the food that you go home and dream about for days! You have to ask them to bring you a side of their homemade ranch dressing and their homemade roumalaide sauce for dipping.. unbelievably delicious!! The homemade yams are almost as good as my moms and that is saying something ! The barbeque fries are loaded with pulled pork, these are all considered appetizers and sides but I am telling you if you order any of the 3 items listed above and  order a side of yams or barbeque fries you will not be able to finish it all. I love the food here. I would've given 5 stars but the server is a little strange, sometimes she barely talks and acts like you are asking for the world when you request ranch or roumalaide and other times she hovers and talks you to death. Also the iced tea is over priced at $3 a glass. Come for the food, not the tea or service, or call ahead and get it to go, yummy stuff.. My entire family loves it!",0x89b6bf99f5337eb1:0xf1e9bb7eca58f878,VA

After speaking to a waitress over the phone for 20 mins I was put on hold only to be hung up on ..... And when I called back the mgr magical appeared and never expressed his apologies but promise me full refund that I never got...

Btw food was salty as hell but I did somewhat like the friend okra .... Oh and did I mention I only ordered side dishes ..... Mac and cheese is average not how that hipped it up to be overall worst experience ever...

2018-05-18 00:27:02.450,2,"Ordered takeout last time I was here, took awhile to be ready but was delicious. Oyster po'boy was great and so were all the sides (I was in love with the fried plantains, mac n cheese had a little too much Italian seasoning). Ordered delivery this time and still haven't gotten my food 50mins past the time it was supposed to arrive. When I called for an update, the call went straight to a full voicemail box.
If you want great food that takes forever and may or may not arrive for delivery, this is the place.
Edit: Food finally arrived a little after 8pm (ordered at 5pm). Driver was polite and apologetic. Food was awful. Everything was cold. Fries were slimy and limp. Oysters in the oyster po'boy had a cornmeal breading this time and were left in the fryer too long. Bread was soggy for both sandwiches. BBQ pulled pork didn't have any BBQ flavor, it was pulled pork with a sauce similar to marinara.

2019-03-27 01:07:47.995,2,"This was our first time trying Fat Fish and we were pretty disappointed, especially given the price. We ordered the grilled seafood tacos and a lobster roll (hot & spicy option). The seafood tacos had such a small amount of fish in them that I had a lot of bites that were just cabbage and tortilla. They also did not have much flavor. Most seafood tacos we've had have some kind of acidic bite to it (maybe lime or tomatoes), but this was just cabbage, fish, and chipotle sauce (and there was not much sauce, either). The lobster roll was packed with lobster and had great flavor, but it was very small and we would have liked it better with a sauce.

Tonight was my third time coming here this is the reason I gave your a one star.  The food shrimp was way over cooked I even took pictures. The green beans tasted sour like the been sitting out. Even the mac and cheese was old didn't even taste hot felt room temperature at best.  I only went here because ya'll had some great shrimp but after tonight don't think I will return. Worst thing is I showed up thinking I am getting great food but instead I get old and over cooked food at 32 dollars I should get hot food. The sad part is the cook had to know it was over cook I worked in seafood restaurants you know when seafood is over cooked,0x89ba9562a22e987d:0xe515df34b45f65a0,VA
2018-09-05 23:38:52.995,2,"I heard great things about this place, but I was not impressed. Let me tell you why. First, the cashier acted as if she was being bothered. Mind you I am the only person in the restaurant. Absolutely, no customer service. She acted as if I was taking up her valuable time. No suggestions, no small talk, no direct eye contact. Nada... My coworker just happen to come in about 10 mins after me and he received the same treatment. I was not impressed with the meal I received for the price. The fish was ok, but I could have did a better job at home with my eyes closed. I think that if the customer service was better, I would've visited again....but it wasn't worth giving them a second try. On top of all of that, I asked to use the restroom, all I wanted to do was wash my hands....I received the nope it's out of order, nope you can't wash you hands. ..NOPE, NOPE, NOPE.

As a previous employee of the establishment, the people who work there are generous and very nice plus the atmosphere is relaxing. I could say alot of bad things about the place because I was treated wrong and felt singled out when I worked there right before I left from there but I am not that type of person. The staff is friendly, courteous, generous, easy going and can make you feel welcome plus make you feel like family. It is an affordable and convenient restaurant for this area and the people who work there are like family. It's not a Long John's for sure, it's even better. That's just my opinion.

Food: This place offers a variety of different types of seafoods. Crabs, shrimps, fresh, oysters, crawfish, crab cakes and several other items. They can cook the food for you or you can grab the items fresh and take them home. Another thing worth mentioned is the soul food they offer as well. Mac and cheese, greens, potatoes, french fries, baked and fried chicken and corn bread.

Location: It is located on jeff davis. Not an ideal location but it will do. The hours they are open are decent. Don't expect to come to place after hours.

2020-01-06 02:25:53.152,5,"This place is a hidden gem (""hidden"" on the far, back corner of the strip mall).

(1) Great atmosphere ... good background music, plenty of TVs that carry the games - and if you want to hear the TV, the bartender/waitress will give you a small wireless speaker so you can hear the play-by-play w/o disturbing others!

(2) Very reasonable prices.

(3) Large & tasty oysters (I think my buddy downed at least two dozen).

(4) A versatile menu that can satisfy landlubbers like myself (generous-sized salads that you can substitute turkey & ham for seafood, burgers, steak, grilled chicken, etc.). If you have a non-seafood eater in your group, they don't have to sacrifice so the rest of your party can enjoy their seafood!

(5) One of my favorites: the homemade hush puppies by the basket!

(6) Oh, I almost forgot ... happy hour appetizer specials (even on the weekend).

Lauren, the bar tender, was sociable and very attentive - our glasses/mugs were never empty.  She's a great asset to this establishment.

The rude bartender berated my guest by saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feel sorry for me with your Drunken whisper‚Äù. We were not drunk, we went here to get drinks not because we had been drinking. By the looks of things, this place is on the way out. I wish there was some presence of management or feeling that our business was wanted.

2019-08-21 20:59:22.857,2,"To the management:

I admire the challenge of being in such a location yet trying to remain prosperous. It‚Äôs difficult at this location. Here are my suggestions if you don‚Äôt want to close your door (which by the looks of the thin crowd when we visit, this is near).

1) Take care of your customers. I have never once had a manager or someone in a leadership role come over to our table and ask hour our meal was. It‚Äôs a small place and I don‚Äôt believe I even know what the owner looks like, and I‚Äôve been her 5-10 times.

2) For the love of GOD, reduce your prices. The environment is not 4-5 star so you shouldn‚Äôt be charging $28 for 1lb of crab legs that are no better than Publix grocery. Although they are decent, that‚Äôs a travesty.

I‚Äôd like to come back and I‚Äôm sure others will agree that if these 2 points were addressed than you would start to see pickup. I‚Äôm sure this is easier said than done(well #2 at least), but please try. Thanks!!",0x89b16bebf6542ca3:0xf9a5a0ce159809aa,VA

2020-09-08 01:22:03.305,5,"This may be about as perfect of a date night as you can get. They are located in a very quiet area. They have their own parking lot for their customers only. There's not a lot a seating inside and this is one of the few places we've been that's actually pretty quiet while you eat. You can have a good conversation! We started with the bread service and two appetizers, the beet salad and their crab bisque. The bread was fantastic, nice crust good flavor and was accompanied by oil and balsamic. The salad was good and the crab bisque was as good as we've ever eaten. it was crab and nearly every bite and sometimes the crab would be larger than the spoon. Absolutely decadent. For a main course, we ordered the lollipop lamb chops and the beef Wellington. The lollipop lamb chops and the beef Wellington were both ordered mid rare and they both came exactly as ordered! Everything was well seasoned including the vegetables and mashed potatoes. It's rare these days to find a chef that actually seasons and tests before serving. Everything we put in our mouth was first class and we will definitely be back. Get your honey and get to Voila. You will definitely score some points!",0x89ba986d68b5e663:0x81e8207b7eef9837,VA

2021-02-14 03:17:13.407,5,"If we could give 10 stars, I would find a way to try and give 20 more. Wow! Absolutely stunning!!! From the minute I called to make Valentines Day reservations 3 months ago and was told it was made too early to make reservations, I set it on my calender to make reservations on tge earliest day possible the minute they opened. Due to how stunning the woman who answered the phone was and so kind was on the initial call was. The same lady answered on the second time yet again and was so lovely and so professional that I was already in without even ever had the food. My fiance has always wanted a Beef Wellington so after googling places to have one I found this hidden gem. The lady was kind enough to tell me they would not be serving it on Valentines Day due to its popularity so I made reservations on 2/13. In my 41 years of living in Hampton Roads and being one to enjoy fine dining, I have NEVER experienced such excellent food and service and a perfectly spread and well timed out dinner from appetizer to dessert. I wanted scallops and risotto and then the special was Rockfish and risotto and I asked to not even tell me what the price would be and see if I could have both protiens over risotto and they made it happen. It's now named ""Ed over a bed of Risotto"" or how ever you would say it in French. LOL. If you have never been here you must go! Thank you so much to our server, chef and entire staff for making such an amazing Valentines after such a tough year with Covid. 5 Star experience from beggining to end. Thank you all and especially our server whom I am sorry we didn't get you're name because we were so engulfed by our total experience. I'm not paid to make this review, but word of mouth is what makes this world go round and this Precious Gem of a restaurant deserves it. Thanks again!",0x89ba986d68b5e663:0x81e8207b7eef9837,VA

I love the 19th century stone road this restaurant sits on (the street is original stone from the 1800's). Voila is a smaller restaurant (about 12-15 tables), with a small bar and the local fish served is delivered daily from George's Seafood (so you know the fish is fresh and great quality).

The food is absolutely to die for. Being able to taste every intricate spice used with all the flavor to savor. The crab bisque is by far the best I've had in Virginia Beach, everywhere else drowns it with too much Sherry.  The duck was made so tender and moist with the skin perfectly crisp. Their in-house made chocolate mousse made my mouth water. The creme brulee caramelized top was cooked just right to have the right amount of smoky taste the didn't overpower it.

I know it's supposed to be a high-class and upscale place, but it just seems unnecessarily expensive. Example or cocktails or $12 each don't really see why they couldn't be $10.

We made reservations but when we arrived we were told that the only place we could sit was right in front of the path were the staff came in and out of the kitchen although there were several tables that were empty along the walls and in more comfortable places.  Thought this would be a nice place to take my wife for her birthday dinner but we ended up leaving rather quickly due to how uncomfortable we were.  It's too bad really wanted to like this place.,0x89ba986d68b5e663:0x81e8207b7eef9837,VA

It was definitely a positive dining experience! The restaurant is quite small but ambience was intimate and warm. The staff is nice and attentive.

I felt that this restaurant catered to more of a mature palate or at least a sophisticated and adventurous one like mine.

I ordered the escargot for the appetizer. For the entree, I ordered Gratin de Fruits de Mar (Seafood gratin). Everything was exquisite!

This place knows their food and keen on details.

Apetizers were also not great, the lamb meatballs tasted old, lacked moisture but were drenched in grease.   The onion soup was not impressive, zero flavor, the crab dip apetizer may as well be named Crab of the Dead Sea.... becuase it was literally too salty to eat.    $100 tab for mediocre food....  I just can't recommend this place until the food matches what is advertised, I could have gone to Milos for what I paid here and enjoyed seafood that is literally 10x better.",0x89ba986d68b5e663:0x81e8207b7eef9837,VA

2013-04-04 04:08:30.858,5,"Man, oh man, the Tradewinds restaurant! Just mentioning it my taste buds go all crazy. I don't know the chef's name but he must be a magician in the kitchen. I dinned every night during my 4 night stay at Virginia Beach Resort recently, and it was not even a weekend when you'd think they'll go all out on having the best service. It was a feast on my plate every night. Well worth the time, money and all that view- MAGNIFICENT. My hostess, the restaurant manager that stopped to ask how we were doing, my server's excellent tableside manners and that unparallelled view of the sunset over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge- OMG. If you're ever down in Virginia Beach, DO make the effort and go do Tradewinds- you won't regret it. Their best kept secret is that every Wednesday night they have their own version of Yo Yo Ma, going by the name of Lewis McGehee, that makes your bones melt along with your taste buds. I'm far from a romantic but give me a she-crab soup + a great sunset+ wonderful music and it can't ever spell anything better than Tradewinds restaurant at the Virginia Beach Resort Hotel and Conference Center.

Got the dozen starter oysters, and while they tasted fresh, whoever shucked them got lots of grainy shell in the meat. Their dinner special was quite overpriced; $21 for 10 small shrimps broiled in a butter and lemon sauce. For $21, I expected tiger shrimps or something bigger. It was disappointing.

2018-04-14 22:29:00.037,5,"Nothing like finding one of the biggest Mexican seafood restaurant names from Houston so far north.  For those that know how a Saturday morning feels after a late Friday night...this place made it all better.

I was skeptical at first.  The ones in Houston are mainly off main thoroughfares, i.e. I-45, and you CANNOT miss them with those gi-normous signs.  This one is nowhere near the grandeur of the other 11-or-so locations and quite quaint actually.  Very small footprint with a more modest venue.

It wasn't bustling during lunch hour when we walked in so the skepticism grew twice-fold.  It was wife/kid in tow and the bar was full!  No one sitting at the tables.  One thing that verified within 10 seconds of walking was that something was good at this joint.

We have been seeking our go-to Mexican, not Mexi-dorean as is commonplace here, for over a year now.  El Paso is ok but just melting cheese on my burrito doesn't make it ""authentic"".  We have tried Tacos Moya and were treated so horrible that by principle can't go back.

Back to this joint...the hostess essentially let us sit wherever we wanted being that nobody cared for a non-bar seat.  We were cool with that and bee-lined to a booth just past a small Banda platform.  Must have a karaoke or actual live music on occasion.  THE Selena looked down at me as I sat down.

Drinks? Micheladas, please!  My friends, if you're still with me, this was the first time I poured my own beer into the Michelada mix at a restaurant.  Is it a big deal?  Of course it is.  Could have used a few ice cubes but the heat, lime, saltiness and powdered rim was there on a chilled mug that my thirst desired.
Salsa was good also. Not just blended tomato with no salt.

Food?  Coktel ""Vuelve a la Vida"" please!  I could taste the freshness as I inhaled it.  The hint of ketchup mixed with Valentina and  each chilled bite of shrimp, squid, oyster and pico made me reminisce of the times I would frequent my go-to restaurants.

Oh, and the kid approves also.  She had a quesadilla with fajita.  She doesn't like anything interrupting her ""tortilla and cheese"" but she...ate...the...whole...thing. As well as most of her rice and beans.  She always eats the chips but she ate most of those, too.

As we waited two other families came in with infants.  One was a white couple. Let's not complicate an observation as I simply state it because I feel it should be mentioned in today's frame of strife with the Hispanic population.  To add to this, he ordered a fajita entree and it came out with the signature sizzling and aroma of grilled veggies that makes it even more appetizing. He was not phased even with him handling the baby inches from it.  Mexican-restaurant veterans they were!

Some shortcomings that were minor we overlooked with quality of our food. Cokteles normally come with saltines and lime.  Maybe she was new?  We didn't bother her because again it was a full bar and only two servers.

Will visit again.  Maybe even tomorrow to try those fajitas.",0x89b65ce17fe5fea3:0xd1895be95af809ec,VA

English is not their strong point.  Get over it.
The kids work the front desk a lot, and sometimes they act like kids do.  Dont expect flawless customer service, but always expect food cooked consistently well.  I have eaten there for 5 years and they have never messed up my General Tso chicken or any of my other orders.
The kids are normally nice and the adults in the back are even nicer.

Went here last night and got the general tso's, chicken lo mein, chicken teriyaki, fried rice, egg rolls and spring rolls. The lo mein, ried rice, egg rolls, and spring rolls were very unappealing. The general tso's sauce tasted like it was ketchup, and the chicken wasn't very high quality either. The chicken teriyaki tasted like maple syrup. Overall a very poor experience.

2017-04-09 21:22:26.715,2,Just left this LJS.  Had to wait 20 minutes to get my food (that I had to come in and get). As I came in the guy came from around the counter. Only for me to see when I check my food after getting back in the road that the fish and chicken is burned ... AND I didn't have my potato wedges but you broke my family side of green beans down into 3 small containers. TERRIBLE! I understand people have bad days but this is bad. So I got a 12pc family meal with butt chicken and fish and 2 of 3 sides,0x89b16b37f1cc6917:0x9e8cc22afd8a0970,VA

Another employee was a young girl working very hard while very pregnant. Manager frustrated and mostly uncaring. Other than the fish being a little greasy it wasn't bad.

The food comes in a timely manner, the menu selection is thorough, and the fried whiting is some of the best i've ever had. The coating is light tempura - like batter, perfect for fish sandwiches. The prices are very reasonable, and the hush puppies are sweet and amazing - like a dessert in themselves.

They were understaffed and therefore I certainly understood a longer than normal wait time, but I ran out of my drink twice, a serious pet peeve of mine. The filet was horrible, it was burned and so dry I couldn't even eat it. The broccoli was tasteless and undercooked. My wife's salmon was perfect and the seared scallops were delicious...though the mozzarella sticks were out of the freezer.

However we had a older lady for a waitress and the service we received was horrible. It is bad enough to have a waitress that doesn't provide good service by checking on you periodically, filling request... IE steak sauce, or request for refills etc. When paying a premium to dine I absolutely refuse to be treated rudely while doing so. She may not be a normal waitress and others may not have experienced a issue. In all honesty she acted like she wasn't worried about repercussions. All I can say is she will never wait on me again. I doubt I will ever be back as all of us were dissatisfied with the service. Gratuity was added in as there were 6 of us. However I did not pay the full tip. I think it's pretty funny when I wouldn't pay the full tip the waitress said ""Well I guess I will pay it"". Just about sums up my experience with the waitress.

2017-08-08 03:22:18.868,3,"Since the evening was going to be gorgeous and being that it was Saturday, figured it would be prudent to make a reservation.  Upon arrival, I was quickly greeted by the manager. She made us feel welcomed and immediately pointed out that we will be seated shortly. I requested if we could have an outside seating. She politely replied that she will try to accommodate our request to the best of her abilities - she was not only able to seat us outside, but we had a good view of the establishment and the vicinity surrounding us from where we sat.

Waitress was friendly. She asked what we would like to have for drinks,  we made an order and I replied that we still needed to look over the menu. While we're looking over the menu, we felt something sticking to BOTH of our menus. Not sure whether the remnants of sashimi were already laying on the table and stuck to our menus, or the waitress didn't cleaned them properly - no matter how you slice it, it's just not a good look.

We started out with Spicy Turn Rolls and Canary Island Rolls. Sushi arrived in relatively short time. The presentation was impeccable, but I wish I could say the same about about the taste. I know I enjoy my food spicy, and I'm fully aware when it says spicy, that it's made spicy for the general consumption. However,  I did not feel a single pinch of spice which my date can attest to :)  The rolls tasted gamy and just not up to the level the restaurant has lived up to in the past. Maybe the Sushi Chef wasn't having a good day, or today's delivery just wasn't the freshest - who knows.

On to my entree, the OB Fish Tacos. Lets just say the establishment was able to redeem itself. The fish was crispy with just the right amount of batter. The cilantro and avocado were fresh and the garlic aioli was fantastic.

I really enjoyed the ambiance they've created with number of actual fish tanks spread throughout the entire restaurant, with unique blend of exterior and interior seating setup. On the contrary, finding the restrooms were reminiscent of playing a game of finding 'The Secret Door' - I guess that's why the waitress stood there expecting us to ask about the restrooms, based on how it quickly it rolled out of her tongue, ""I can help you find where the restrooms are"" :)

I will go there again, but they need to work little bit on cleanliness and maybe the sushi should live up the establishment's name as it has in the past.",0x89b639c3fb427b4d:0x4260d9c666e0e454,VA

Staff is average, fish tanks are also a cool touch. Ordered appetizers which came out Luke warm. The actually taste wasn't bad for calamari, little more spice would've been good.

Wife ordered salmon which was a little fishy, but overall not terrible.

My food surf and turf well that was kinda terrible. Steak was cold, over cooked, just like the lobster. The mash was good.

I had the poke, which was quite good. I also enjoyed the Maryland roll, but found it was a bit salty. My friend liked the Caribbean roll.
The beer selection was very nice and well priced, and the happy hour seems great.

My only issue is that they talk about fishing sustainably, but they fly the fish in from Hawaii on pretty much a daily basis. Not very environmentally responsible. Just something to think about.",0x89b639c3fb427b4d:0x4260d9c666e0e454,VA

I really didn't complain because I was super hungry. But then my boyfriend noticed it and said that his burger was burned on one side.
Server came to the table to apologize and said the dessert was on them. But then he never came back to the table for 20 minutes.

Prices are a bit high for the portions for both appetizers and sushi. Same for the regatta style sushi boats, the bill will sneak up on you.

Ramen bar looks like the best bang for your buck at $5 a bowl, but note no meat available. Calamari was better than expected and served with mango. The chicken island sandwich had an aioli that wasn't great and a sauce for the fries that was awful. The sandwich was overall very tasty.

My husband had the vegetable spring rolls and the chicken with broccoli and brown rice. He said they were basically good, I did not try them.

I had the BBQ spareribs which were dry and flavorless. I also tried the seafood delight on the chef specialties dinner menu. The ingredients were very fresh, but the sauce was bland and I needed to douse it with two packages of soy sauce to get it to taste like anything.

I had been eyeing this restaurant through my drives past the shopping center. It was a nice experience.

We got the imperial dip as an appetizer, it was good but not great. I would try another appetizer next time I visit (I do plan on visiting another time :)).

Onto the entrees ... we had the Bang Bang shrimp Tacos and the Baja fish tacos. Both were seasoned deliciously and were juicy. They did not go cheap on the amount of meat per taco. I do wish the fries tasted fresher though. Our waiter, William B. was nice enough to replace my original dish - the gnocchi therm. I had been excited to try the gnocchi which is a restaurant favorite. I was disappointed, it seemed like a stew of leftovers. He was awesome enough to replace my dish and had my replacement (baja fish tacos) ready in a reasonable time. Because of his service and understanding I give this restaurant 4 stars :).

One small suggestion for the restaurant adding some kind of walls. The restaurant feels like a ballroom is being used as a restaurant. Another suggestion is to stop using paper table cloth on top of the cotton kind. It left my partner with finger and arm paper cuts. Small flaws that can easily be fixed.

Will definitely come again, because of the food and service.",0x89b645e3e2f789d7:0xc6c78652fd3d5298,VA

There were four of us. We had a bread and appetizer to start while we decided on the menu. Then the bread was all gone we had to ask 3 times for another loaf and was told t is still in the oven.

2018-08-05 19:19:19.964,5,"I had a long day of work, and wanted to relax with a good meal. I haven't been to  Bonefish in a long time, many years, and decided to stop by this BoneFish for a meal. The young waiter (unfortunately, I didn't get his name), was so helpful and friendly. The restaurant wasn't busy, with several patrons in addition to me sitting in the dining room. My waiter was very attentive. He made recommendations, and came back to check on me. I ordered the mussel appetizer, and he suggested that I dip the bread into the broth, and it was delicious. He had short conversation with me about my meal, and since I was dining alone, it was nice to have a good conversation with my meal, and at the same time, my waiter knew to leave me alone so that I can enjoy my food. The food was pretty good, but it was on the lighter side when it comes to salt. I don't eat a lot of salt, and prefer my food very lightly salted, but the seabass had very little salt. I prefer it had a little more, and I don't like adding salt to my meal once it has been served unless it needs it badly. I ate it as it. The sauteed spinach was delicious and so was the asparagus.

My family and I decided to eat at Bonefish Grill on Labor Day to celebrate my wife's birthday. When we arrived, we were quickly seated.

I won't detail everything, but I was incredibly impressed with our server. He was incredibly attentive to our needs. We asked him for several things, and he didn't bat an eye about any of them.  When I received my steak, I was talking to my wife about how it was overcooked. I was going to just eat it, it's not a big deal. However, our server overheard me as he walked by, so he asked if he could replace it with a steak that was cooked to what I asked for. I said no, but he insisted. When my new steak came out, it was cooked perfectly and he included an extra crabcake for me. What an amazing gesture!  Bonefish Grill went above and beyond. We were incredibly happy! Bonefish Grill and our server did many other things that have convinced us that we will be coming back again.

The food was excellent! We had the codfish sliders, which we love. The Bang Bang Shrimp is always a favorite. And all the dishes we ordered were amazing.

Because of the great food and great experience, we have told so many friends about how they need to eat here.

Everything was delicious!  We ordered a watermelon martini (for the wife) and it was actually really good!  If I'm going to drink a foo-foo drink, I at least want to taste the advertised fruit instead of pure sugar, and this drink was a perfect blend of watermelon with a slight hint of alcohol.

The fresh baked bread is amazing. Crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside...talk about self control to not eat everything in one gulp!  We ordered the sashimi appetizer and were pleasantly surprised with the size of the dish.  It was a great plate of tuna, greens and siracha drizzle.

My wife ordered the scallops and I ordered the crusted haddock.  Both dishes were perfectly cooked, flavorful and filling.  The thing I appreciate is that there are plenty of wild caught fish to choose from with only a couple fish being farm raised.  There aren't many places that offer such a wide variety of seafood choices, and the fact that Bonefish is aware of how much better wild caught fish is makes me have it at the top of my seafood list!",0x89b645e3e2f789d7:0xc6c78652fd3d5298,VA

6pm - Saturday night and it was packed. There was a line of people waiting. We were given one of those square blinking lights gadget standard with a lot of the chain restaurants.

It was nice they had servers going around with tasting while the people waited. Nice touch.

6:45pm- Gadget lights up. The hostess said it would just take a few minutes as our table was getting ready.

7:00pm - Seated and a very friendly server went through the menu with us. We started with the Cerviche  and Singapore Calamari. I would have to say the cerviche had a nice tartness and was pretty good. The calamari was a bit over fried and I didn't really like the sweet dipping sauce that came with it.

7:30pm - The entrees came out, the Fish and Chips, the grilled scallops and shrimp and grilled Grouper. All the seafood that came out seem fresh. The sauces that were recommended to try was also okay. I don't know if it really added any flavor to the dishes.  I've had better Fish & Chips. Everything was cooked nicely and it tasted perfectly fine. It tasted like a chain restaurant pumping out food. The standards were good but not very exciting. It wasn't a bad meal but then it wasn't a memorable meal.

8:30pm - We decided to skip desert and asked for the bill.

8:45pm - Out the door. While the service was exemplary and the food fresh but middling. It follows the tried and true formula of chain restaurants. Consistent food and service but what it lacks is the depth.",0x89b645e3e2f789d7:0xc6c78652fd3d5298,VA

I don't have pictures for everyone this I had eaten but all of the food was amazing from the appetizers (crab dip, calamari, green fried tomatoes, large shrimp, BBQ wings) to my entree (crab stuffed flounder which is pictured) to my dessert that I had to take home because I was so happily full key lime pie (which is pictured and by far the best that I have had). I can't wait to go back again and enjoy something else. There are so many decisions that it's quite hard to pick what you want. But I hop to go back and try more before we have to move closer to the end of the year.

Go and try this place for yourself. It's one of those tasty hidden gems out there.",0x89bac0c1c57965c1:0x1351d4f8922198e3,VA

He gave great recommendations and always checked to see how were doing.

I had She-Crab Soup, a Sirloin Sandwich,  and Key Lime Pie .  My wife had Fried Calamari, a popular Eggs Benedict Dish, and Bread Pudding.   We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ate!

I appreciated the birthday gestures extended to my wife, as did she,  and we look forward to going back for the dinner menu, soon.   I can't wait to try the Sweet Potato-crusted Salmon.",0x89bac0c1c57965c1:0x1351d4f8922198e3,VA

This is not a moderately priced catering company and the the terms, the amount of food and the time the food was going to be served that we had agreed upon we're not met ...the food that was served was delicious but there was not enough which was their responsibility and they were paid very well. They stopped serving  hours before they were supposed to ..it was very difficult to reach the company after the wedding... after some very persistent conversations they did give us a partial refund which we agreed on only because I was tired of dealing with the issue.

Well, I would've rather been embarrassed than spend almost $200 on 2 meals and a couple drinks. Apparently the Valentines cuisine as $65/head, & their drink they claimed was on ""special"" that night was $10/per. Way over priced especially compared to normal & the server didn't even do a good job! The food was not worth that much, as I've had better, & I also was not full when I left.

There are choices that are a little easier on the wallet as well for those who want a good meal at a reasonable price.  The waitstaff are very friendly and helpful, and always attentive to your needs.  There is outdoor dining with a great view of the local greenery.  The drink selection is varied, from fine wine to their own moonshine based cocktails and even beer if you feel so inclined.  They are located near the Courthouse, and within easy driving distance of the beach and Lynnhaven areas.

The selection of food varies greatly, from crabcakes and many other seafood specialties to pasta and anything in between.  The food and drink are high end, however the ambiance is very friendly and relaxed.  They just opened a few weeks back and already are taking reservations to get in, so stop by soon to see just how great it is for yourself, before you have to make reservations days in advance.

Right off the bat a man meets us at the door and invites Us in for a drink,tells my husband that he would buy him a drink.  By the time he walked us to the bar he forgot. So we sat next to him. The man beside us was so drunk it was disgusting. The bartenders need to know when to stop serving. We had to leave abruptly because of the crude comments the man kept suggesting to my husband.  Luckily I know when to get out because it would have been a bad night.
Over all the food was great I even found two little crabs in are oysters the drinks are awesome; we had beers. We will come again just will not join John at the bar.

The breading fell off while trying to cut pieces from my fish. It's as if they didn't season the breading at all. The service was slow and inattentive.

2019-11-03 13:58:05.019,2,"This was one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences I've ever had. I wanted to take my husband somewhere nice for his birthday and had heard great things about this place. Apparently the great service is reserved for friends of the owners. The waiter was not even aware of the TWO beers they had on tap, having to go ask the bartender. He only addressed my husband each time he came to the table. The beets in my salad and my husband's $5 side of ""roasted"" beets were clearly from a can. My shrimp and grits entree had a total of 3 average size shrimp. The rest of the entree was so bland that even the sausage and bacon had no flavor. My husband's crab cakes were literally that, just crab. there was little to no seasoning or flavor. I assume that would have been remedied by the roumelade but your entree should stand alone, without a condiment, especially for the price we paid. We could have had a better meal at a chain restaurant and paid a fraction of what this meal cost. It wears the mask of fine dining but left a lot to be desired.",0x8852b480023afd11:0xe0ab2f6bbaef6afe,VA

2019-07-17 20:21:21.276,4,Went there to try it out. The crab cakes were pretty good. Service was excellent. I expected it to be a bit pricier for the fine dining side of things. However it was a bit more than I thought was warranted for what we received. Steak was a bit on the bland side and didnt care for the vegetables at all. Hate to sound all negative but I've had way better meals for way less money. If you want fine dining this is your place. If you want some really great food look elsewhere. Gave it 4 stars because they got 90 percent there...but if you dont enjoy the food what's the point of it being a restaurant?,0x8852b480023afd11:0xe0ab2f6bbaef6afe,VA

The food was lackluster at best.  The beets in the beet salad tasted as if they were canned.  The crab cakes were not great which was really disappointing as I had hear great things about them.  There was a lot of fat and not the marbling kind on my steak.  For the price they were charging I would have preferred not paying for fat.

Her chicken was so rubbery that the steak knife didnt work either. I was halfway done with my steak by the time the manager came over. I told him about my over cooked steak, which wasnt a big issue as accidents happen, but the chicken was unacceptable. He completely ignored our comments about the chicken and proceeded to go on and on about how great their cuts of beef are. We even showed him the steak knife wouldnt cut through it. He tried to offer us some random historic book in the resturant for compensation. A book!?! Seriously. Girlfriend only ate maybe a third of her chicken. We paid and left. Will not return.

2019-07-28 19:55:25.096,4,"Called in my order of the Waffle Cake Trio,  which included the Sweet Chili wings,  Mild Buffalo shrimp and the waffle cake fries,  that was very yummy.  Portions and food were good and I will visit again.  The only reason I can't give Divers 5 stars is because I called my order in and went to the restaurant 20 minutes later to pick it up. That's when the cashier informed me that they forgot to put my order in,  which lead to an additional 20 minute wait time. My tips for visiting this restaurant is to find the menu from their website and call your order in because seating is limited and the ventilation is bad, I left smelling like a fry cook because of my 20 minute wait.  Parking is also limited.",0x89baa32d79d5afbd:0x9b338ad01161e81c,VA

The sweet potato pie had a lot of butter in it so much that it coated the inside of my mouth. Never experienced this before. The best part was the sweet potato cheesecake. I would return for that alone,0x89baa32d79d5afbd:0x9b338ad01161e81c,VA

A more cooked, less salted version of chick fil et fries.

After a bit we were told the bartender left so we could only have water and that a phone order came in for sushi so we couldn't order sushi.  We tried one of the other appetizers and it was not something I would order again...the texture and the flavor were pretty gross.  Another table was seated next to us and shortly after they all received beer and wine...we were quite perplexed since we were told no alcohol could be served since the bartender left.  We were never offered anything more but water and were quite disappointed that we couldn't order one single sushi roll while in the restaurant since a phone order took priority.

The staff was friendly and helpful, especially with the children. Without asking, the server brought small plastic ""hinges"" for the children's chopsticks that allowed them to eat more easily. After the meal, our server brought out to-go cups for the kids' sodas, again, without having to be asked.

They decided to start charging an outrageous price for yum yum sauce if you want more than 2 tiny cups with the meal. But fine, whatever ill pay even though the cost is a bit much. But the breaking point is when I spend $60 on a meal for 2, get one meal (steak and chicken ordered the steak  medium well) and get the other meal new York steak ordered medium RARE, and BOTH were cooked well done. Way to ruin a steak. Idk if they're getting laY since its take out only and they tie the bags around the boxes very tight so people can't check their food. But if I'm paying this much I expect my food to be cooked correctly. This isnt tgi fridays cheap food. They should not be way over cooking my food.
